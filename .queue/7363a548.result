1. **Start with design mockups first** (before coding)
2. **Create an interactive HTML playground** for design exploration

Let me invoke the frontend-design skill to create a Terminator-themed design mockup.I'll create a distinctive Skynet dashboard with a Terminator-inspired aesthetic. Let me design something memorable.

## Design Direction: **Military-Industrial Cyberpunk**

**Concept**: A command center interface that feels like you're accessing a sentient AI defense network. Cold, precise, slightly unsettling - like Skynet itself is watching.

**Key Elements**:
- Monospace/terminal typography mixed with sharp geometric headers
- Deep black backgrounds with scanning line effects
- Cyan (#00d4ff) as primary "system active" color
- Red (#ff3333) as warning/accent
- Grid overlay patterns suggesting surveillance
- Subtle CRT flicker and scan line effects
- Hexagonal/geometric card designs
- "Neural network" connecting lines between systems

Let me build this:Now I'll create the Skynet dashboard in the skynet subdirectory and the InsuredHQ page:Now let me create the InsuredHQ operations page:I've created the Skynet design mockups. Let me provide you with the links.
