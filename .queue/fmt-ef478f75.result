# TASK.md - Fix Login Crash on Invalid Password

## Overview

The login system currently crashes when a user enters an incorrect password. This needs to be fixed to gracefully handle authentication failures by displaying an appropriate error message instead of crashing the application.

## User Story

I want to see a clear error message when I enter the wrong password
So that I understand why my login failed and can try again without the application crashing

## Requirements

- [ ] Prevent application crash when incorrect password is entered
- [ ] Display a user-friendly error message for invalid credentials

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Entering an incorrect password does not crash the application
- [ ] Error message clearly indicates authentication failure
- [ ] Username field is preserved after failed login attempt
- [ ] Password field is cleared after failed login attempt
