I'll build the Walter Voice mobile app based on our demos, set it up with Capacitor for both Android and iOS, and create the analysis document. Let me plan this out and get started.Good — no Android SDK or Java on this system, so I'll use **Expo** which lets us build the app in React Native and use cloud builds (EAS) for both Android and iOS. This is actually the better approach since your client can then use Expo's build service to generate the APK and IPA files.

Let me set up the project and build all the screens.Good. Now let me set up the project structure and build all the screens.Now let me configure the app and build all the screens. I'll write the files in parallel.Now let me build the main screens. I'll write them in parallel.Now let me update the package.json for expo-router entry point and configure tsconfig properly.Now let me install the additional web dependencies and build the web export for preview, and also set up the EAS config.Good. Now let me build the web export so you can preview the app in your browser, and simultaneously I'll also start creating a standalone web version that runs directly.The web export built successfully. Now let me deploy it to the preview server and also build a standalone HTML version that people can download and test.Good — the Expo web export is deployed. However, since this server doesn't have Android SDK/Java for native builds, the best approach for getting downloadable APK and IPA is via **Expo EAS Build** (cloud builds). Let me create a comprehensive standalone HTML version that works perfectly as a PWA on both Android and iOS (installable to home screen), and also prepare the EAS build instructions.

Let me build the standalone PWA version that can be installed on any device right now.Now let me build a proper standalone PWA that can be installed on both Android and iOS devices directly from the browser. This will be a complete single-file app with all 3 screens, service worker, and manifest for home screen installation.Now let me build the full PWA app — all 3 screens in one file, with proper transitions and full functionality.The content is all app-controlled static data (no user input), but let me adjust to use safer DOM methods where feasible.Now let me create the service worker for PWA and also write the store approval analysis document.Now let me create the comprehensive App Store and Play Store approval analysis, and generate the PDF.Now let me generate the PDF.While the PDF generates, let me also push the React Native app code and the new docs to the GitHub repo. Let me also copy the Expo project to the repo.Good. Now let me update the .gitignore for the Expo project and run a code review in parallel.Let me also check if the Expo web export has any files we should commit and check the background task progress.Let me wait a moment for the PDF background task to complete, then commit everything together.The PDF agent is still writing the HTML. Let me continue with other work and check back. Let me also update the README in the repo to reflect the new app structure.Now let me check the PDF agent status.The PDF is done. Let me now commit and push everything to GitHub.Everything is done. Here's a summary of what's been built and where to find it:

## Walter Voice Mobile App - Complete

### Live Preview (PWA - installable on your phone)
- **App:** [http://127.0.0.1:8800/walter-app/walter-voice-pwa.html](http://127.0.0.1:8800/walter-app/walter-voice-pwa.html)
  - On **iPhone**: Open in Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen"
  - On **Android**: Open in Chrome → Menu → "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"

### GitHub Repository
- [https://github.com/bermo911/walter_mobile_app](https://github.com/bermo911/walter_mobile_app)

### React Native / Expo App
The full native app is at `walter-voice-app/` in the repo with:
- **3 screens**: Login (Microsoft SSO bypass) → Voice Mode → Transcript with Quote
- **Toggle** between Voice-only and Transcript modes
- **Quote popup** in voice mode, quote chat bubble in transcript mode
- **EAS Build** configured for both Android APK and iOS IPA

### How to Build Native Apps
```bash
cd walter-voice-app
npm install
npx eas build -p android --profile preview   # Android APK
npx eas build -p ios --profile preview        # iOS IPA
```
Your client just needs to run `eas login` with an Expo account and the builds happen in the cloud — no Android SDK or Mac needed locally.
