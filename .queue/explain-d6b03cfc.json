{"id": "explain-d6b03cfc", "message": "Please explain this Markdown document file in simple, easy-to-understand terms for someone who may not have technical skills.\n\n**File:** .claude/commands/revise-claude-md.md\n\n**Content:**\n```\n---\ndescription: Update CLAUDE.md with learnings from this session\nallowed-tools: Read, Edit, Glob\n---\n\nReview this session for learnings about working with Claude Code in this codebase. Update CLAUDE.md with context that would help future Claude sessions be more effective.\n\n## Step 1: Reflect\n\nWhat context was missing that would have helped Claude work more effectively?\n- Bash commands that were used or discovered\n- Code style patterns followed\n- Testing approaches that worked\n- Environment/configuration quirks\n- Warnings or gotchas encountered\n\n## Step 2: Find CLAUDE.md Files\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"CLAUDE.md\" -o -name \".claude.local.md\" 2>/dev/null | head -20\n```\n\nDecide where each addition belongs:\n- `CLAUDE.md` - Team-shared (checked into git)\n- `.claude.local.md` - Personal/local only (gitignored)\n\n## Step 3: Draft Additions\n\n**Keep it concise** - one line per concept. CLAUDE.md is part of the prompt, so brevity matters.\n\nFormat: `<command or pattern>` - `<brief description>`\n\nAvoid:\n- Verbose explanations\n- Obvious information\n- One-off fixes unlikely to recur\n\n## Step 4: Show Proposed Changes\n\nFor each addition:\n\n```\n### Update: ./CLAUDE.md\n\n**Why:** [one-line reason]\n\n\\`\\`\\`diff\n+ [the addition - keep it brief]\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n## Step 5: Apply with Approval\n\nAsk if the user wants to apply the changes. Only edit files they approve.\n\n```\n\nPlease provide:\n1. **What This File Does** - A simple one-paragraph summary\n2. **Key Components** - Break down the main parts/sections in plain language\n3. **How It Works** - Explain the flow or logic simply\n4. **Important Things to Know** - Any key details a non-technical person should understand\n\nUse simple analogies where helpful. Avoid jargon or explain technical terms when you must use them.\n\nIMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with the explanation. Do not use any tools, do not read any files, do not make any changes.
