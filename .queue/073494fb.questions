Here's the evidence:\n\n**The diff shows a massive rewrite**: 444 lines deleted, 208 lines inserted \u2014 that's not an incremental edit, it's a ground-up rebuild.\n\n**What the new voice page contains:**\n\n1. **Dual render paths** \u2014 completely separate web (`<div>` based) and native (`<View>/<Pressable>` based) implementations, following the pattern from our key lessons\n2. **Animated breathing orb** \u2014 a central logo button with 3 concentric pulsing rings using CSS `@keyframes` on web (avoiding the unreliable RN Animated API)\n3. **Press-to-talk interaction** \u2014 pressing the orb turns it red (recording state), releasing returns to purple\n4. **Dark theme** \u2014 `#0a0612` background with purple accent (`#7c3aed`) rings\n5. **Navigation** \u2014 bottom button to go to the transcript page\n6. **\"NEW PAGE\" label** \u2014 explicitly marking it as the new page (line 78 for web, line 189 for native)\n\nThe current code is **uncommitted** (working tree changes only, not yet in any commit). It replaced the previous, much larger voice.tsx (444 lines removed) with a cleaner, purpose-built implementation.\n\nWould you like me to rebuild the web export and restart the PM2 server so you can preview it at [http://127.0.0.1:5177/voice](http://127.0.0.1:5177/voice)?", "waiting": true}
