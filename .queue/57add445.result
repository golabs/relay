I need to understand what you want to search before designing the feature.

**What should the search feature cover?**

1. **Chat history** - Search through past conversations and messages
2. **Files in project** - Search file names and contents in the current project
3. **Skills & commands** - Search available skills and their documentation
4. **Everything** - Universal search across chat, files, and skills

Which scope do you want? (Or describe something different)
