I've already implemented these enhancements. Let me verify the changes are in place and summarize what was done:**Done!** I've implemented comprehensive enhancements for detailed agent activity reporting with voice capability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Watcher (watcher.py)
- **Natural language descriptions** for all tools
- **Agent type names**: Explorer, Planner, Research Agent, Command Agent
- **Agent IDs** extracted and displayed (8-char short IDs)
- **Detailed context**: Shows file paths, search patterns, command descriptions
- **Multi-agent tracking**: Shows count when multiple agents are running

### 2. Enhanced Frontend Display (app.js)
- **Rich tool descriptions** with emojis and context:
  - `🤖 Explorer (ae5df43): Debug delete project API`
  - `🔍 Searching for "login|auth" in codebase`
  - `📖 Reading file: api_handlers.py`
  - `💻 Running git status`

### 3. Voice Announcements
- **`speakActivityUpdate()`** function announces:
  - Agent launches ("Explorer starting: Debug delete project API")
  - Major activity changes (searches, web lookups)
  - Task completions
- **5-second cooldown** prevents spam
- **Only when auto-read is enabled**
- Uses Edge TTS for natural voice

### What You'll Now See/Hear

When agents run, instead of:
> "Agent ae5df43 (Settings page): Reading files..."

You'll see and hear:
> "🤖 Explorer (ae5df43): Settings page - Reading file: settings.html, searching for API configuration patterns"

**Refresh your browser** to get the updated JavaScript. The next time you run a task with agents, you'll get much more detailed natural language updates with voice announcements.
