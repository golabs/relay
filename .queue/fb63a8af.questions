Let me read it first:The InsuredHQ page already exists. Let me update the todo list and provide the links:## Design Mockups Complete\n\nI've created interactive HTML mockups for the Skynet application with the Terminator-themed design:\n\n### View the Designs\n\n- **Main Dashboard**: [http://127.0.0.1:8800/skynet/](http://127.0.0.1:8800/skynet/)\n- **InsuredHQ Operations**: [http://127.0.0.1:8800/skynet/insuredhq.html](http://127.0.0.1:8800/skynet/insuredhq.html)\n\n### Design Features Implemented\n\n**Visual Theme (Terminator/Skynet Aesthetic)**:\n- Deep black backgrounds with cyan (#00d4ff) and red (#ff3333) accents\n- Scan line overlay effect (CRT monitor feel)\n- Grid pattern background\n- Animated neural network background on dashboard\n- Glowing effects and subtle animations\n- Orbitron font for headers (futuristic military feel)\n- Share Tech Mono for terminal-style text\n\n**Dashboard (index.html)**:\n- Central command hub with \"SKYNET\" branding\n- System cards with live stats (endpoints, API calls, latency)\n- Status indicators (online/offline)\n- Animated neural network visualization\n- Placeholder cards for future API systems\n- Responsive mobile layout\n\n**InsuredHQ Operations (insuredhq.html)**:\n- Collapsible sidebar navigation with all operation categories\n- 24+ API operation cards organized by:\n  - Claims Management (6 endpoints)\n  - Policies Management (3 endpoints)\n  - Clients/Insureds (4 endpoints)\n  - Documents (3 endpoints)\n  - Sync Operations (5 endpoints)\n  - Accounts/Financial (8 tabs)\n  - Health & Testing (4 endpoints)\n- HTTP method color coding (GET=green, POST=cyan, PUT=yellow, DELETE=red, PATCH=purple)\n- Mobile hamburger menu with overlay\n- Search functionality placeholder\n- Smooth scroll navigation\n\n### Next Steps\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Proceed to `/plan-feature`** to create the full Python implementation plan?\n2. **Refine the design** further before coding?\n3. **Add more interactivity** to the mockups (modals, forms)?", "waiting": true}
