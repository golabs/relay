I need to understand what "option 4" refers to and what portal setup you're asking about. Let me check the context from our previous conversation and the current state of the project.I don't have context about what "option 4" refers to from a previous conversation. Let me check if there's any context file or recent discussion that might clarify this.I don't have the context from a previous conversation about what "option 4" refers to. Could you remind me what the options were? 

Here's what I can see in the current project state:
- **4 HTML demo files** exist (`walter-voice-demo1.html`, `demo2.html`, `demo3.html`, `demos.html`)
- **No `.preview/` directory** is currently set up for the portal
- The app has login, voice, and transcript screens

Could you clarify:
1. **What was "option 4"?** (from a previous conversation I don't have context for)
2. **What do you mean by "the portal"?** — the preview server at [http://127.0.0.1:8800/](http://127.0.0.1:8800/)?
3. **What SSH key access** are you referring to? — SSH into this machine, or SSH keys for GitHub, or something else?

This will help me set everything up correctly for you.
