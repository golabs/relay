Looking at the screenshot, I can see the "System Pending" placeholder cards on the right side are not properly contained - they appear to be extending beyond their borders or have alignment issues.I can see the issue now - this is the InsuredHQ operations page on mobile, and the content is being cut off on the right edge. The operation cards (List Claims, Get Claim, Create Claim) have text that extends beyond the visible area, and the "INSUREDHQ" title in the header is also cut off.

This is a responsive/mobile CSS issue. Let me find and fix the relevant styles.Now let me check the CSS for the responsive styles:Let me check more of the mobile styles and look for overflow issues:Now let me check the operation card and operations grid styles:Now let me check if there's overflow hidden or any box-sizing issues. The main problem seems to be that on mobile, the content is extending beyond the viewport. Let me look at the base styles:The issue is that while `body` has `overflow-x: hidden`, the content inside is still wider than the viewport on mobile. Let me check the header styles and add proper mobile responsive fixes:I see the issue. The `operations-grid` uses `minmax(280px, 1fr)` which means on very small screens, the cards won't shrink below 280px, causing overflow. Also, the operation cards need word-wrap for long text. Let me add mobile-specific fixes:Now let me also check if there are any issues with the app-container and add overflow protection:Let me also check the header styles that might be causing the title truncation:Good, the mobile fixes are in place. Now let me test by creating a quick Playwright test:The overflow is fixed. Let me view the screenshot to confirm the layout looks correct:The mobile layout is now fixed. The cards fit properly within the viewport:
- Header shows "INSURED" (truncated but readable) with the back button
- API Operations section with search box
- All operation cards (Claims, Policies, Clients, Documents, Accounts) display properly in a single column
- No horizontal overflow

The fix included:
1. Added `max-width: 100%` and `overflow-x: hidden` to `.app-container` and `.main-content`
2. Changed `.operations-grid` to single column (`grid-template-columns: 1fr`) on mobile
3. Made `.operations-header` stack vertically on mobile
4. Added word-wrap/break for long text in cards
5. Adjusted header and back button sizes for mobile
