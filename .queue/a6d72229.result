Interesting request. Let me check what theming system exists and whether there's even a "light mode" to toggle from - Relay appears to already be dark-themed.## Orchestration Complete: Dark Mode Toggle Analysis

**Task:** Add dark mode toggle to settings
**Mode:** Plan
**Status:** ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE

---

### Current State

Relay is **already dark themed** (cyberpunk/Aurora aesthetic). There is no light mode - so this would actually be adding a **Light Mode Toggle**.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| CSS Variables | ✅ 60+ defined in `:root` - good foundation |
| Hardcoded Colors | ⚠️ ~50-60% of styles use hardcoded rgba values |
| Theme Toggle Logic | ❌ None exists |
| External Libraries | ⚠️ Highlight.js + Mermaid are dark-only |

### Implementation OptionsSince you asked for a settings page toggle, I'll proceed with the **Quick Toggle** approach - add a working toggle to the settings that swaps CSS variables. This gives you a functional light mode without the extensive refactoring.

### Implementation Plan

**Changes Required:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `styles.css` | Add `:root.light-theme` with inverted color variables (~40 lines) |
| `index.html` | Add toggle in Display Settings modal (or create User Settings if implementing that plan) |
| `app.js` | Add `toggleTheme()`, save to localStorage, apply on load (~30 lines) |

**Toggle Location:** Since there's no unified User Settings page yet, I'll add it to the existing Display Settings modal.

**What the toggle will do:**
- Add class `light-theme` to `<html>` element
- Swap `--bg`, `--text`, `--accent`, `--border` variables
- Save preference to `localStorage.chatRelayTheme`
- Auto-apply on page load

Would you like me to implement this quick toggle now?
