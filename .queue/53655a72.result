I understand the task. Let me break it down:

1. **Update Skynet's `.claude` folder** - Copy from WalterAI, but keep Skynet's TASK.md, OUTPUT.md, CLAUDE.md
2. **Create a default `.claude` template** - Store in a central location for Relay to use for new projects
3. **Report any files that need updating**

Let me start by exploring both directories.I see the issue now. Skynet already has a newer structure with skills, but WalterAI has some additional files (EXPLAIN.md, QUESTIONS.md, database.md, etc.) that are missing. Let me merge them properly.Now let me copy the WalterAI files to Skynet that are missing (EXPLAIN.md, QUESTIONS.md, database.md, E2E-TEST-PROCEDURES.md, plan.md, settings.local.json, task_images):Now let me create the default `.claude` template folder for Relay to use for new projects:Now I need to create clean template versions of TASK.md, OUTPUT.md, EXPLAIN.md, and QUESTIONS.md:Now let me update Relay to use the default template when creating new projects:I see the issue - the code is looking for `.templates/claude-template` but I created `.templates/.claude`. Let me fix this:Hmm, there's a nested `.claude` folder. Let me restructure this properly - the template should be the `.claude` folder itself:Now let me create clean template versions of the project-specific files:Now let me generate the report:**Done!** Here's what was completed:

## Summary

### 1. Skynet .claude Updated
Files added from WalterAI:
- `EXPLAIN.md`
- `QUESTIONS.md`
- `database.md`
- `E2E-TEST-PROCEDURES.md`
- `plan.md`
- `settings.local.json`
- `task_images/`

Files preserved (not overwritten):
- `TASK.md` - Kept Skynet's version
- `OUTPUT.md` - Not present in source
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project root (not touched)

### 2. Default Template Created
**Location:** `/opt/clawd/projects/.templates/claude-template/`

Contains 97 files:
- 30+ slash commands (commit, explain, plan-feature, debug-trace, etc.)
- 19 skills (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, frontend-design, etc.)
- Clean template files (TASK.md, OUTPUT.md, EXPLAIN.md, QUESTIONS.md)
- Reference docs (database.md, WORKFLOW.md, plan.md, E2E-TEST-PROCEDURES.md)

### 3. Relay Integration
Relay already uses `/opt/clawd/projects/.templates/claude-template/` when creating new projects. No code changes needed.
