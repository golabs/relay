I need more context about what header styling issue you're experiencing. Let me ask for clarification:Since you mentioned "fix the header styling issue" without specifics, let me quickly investigate the current header state - particularly the logout button I just added, which is the most recent change:## Debug Report: Header Styling Issues Found

The investigation found **2 actual issues** and **1 minor cleanup**:

### Issues Identified

| # | Issue | Severity | Description |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Missing `#mobilePanelLabel` CSS | **HIGH** | The AXION/BRETT label in mobile view has no styling - inherits defaults |
| 2 | Conflicting button classes | **MEDIUM** | `.icon-btn` + `.new-project-btn` on same element causes dimension conflicts |
| 3 | Dead `.health-text` CSS | LOW | Element was removed but CSS remains |

### Quick Fixes

Would you like me to fix these issues? Here's what I'd do:

**Fix 1:** Add CSS for the mobile panel label
```css
#mobilePanelLabel {
    font-weight: 600;
    font-size: 11px;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    color: var(--text-bright);
}
```

**Fix 2:** Update the new project button to avoid class conflicts

**Fix 3:** Remove dead CSS for `.health-text`

If you're seeing a **different** header issue (like something specific with the logout button, colors, or alignment), please describe what you're seeing and I'll dig deeper.

Should I proceed with these fixes?
