Before I launch a fleet of agents to hunt for a \"login bug\" in this codebase, let me point out something relevant:\n\n**This is Relay** \u2014 a chat interface and orchestration layer for Claude AI. Looking at the header and the codebase structure, this appears to be a *local development tool*, not a user-facing application with authentication.\n\nLet me quickly verify what we're actually dealing with here.As I suspected. **There is no login function in this codebase.** Those results are just filename pattern matching in screenshot handling, not actual authentication logic.\n\nRelay is a local development tool that runs on `localhost:7786`. It doesn't have:\n- User authentication\n- Login/logout functionality\n- Session management\n\n## Your Options\n\n1. **If you want to ADD authentication to Relay** \u2014 I can design and implement a login system (session-based, JWT, API keys, etc.)\n\n2. **If the \"logout button\" request was about something else** \u2014 like a \"disconnect from Claude session\" or \"clear chat history\" button, I can add that.\n\n3. **If you're thinking of a different project** \u2014 let me know which codebase has the login bug you're referring to.\n\nWhat's the actual mission here, Cooper? I can't debug a function that doesn't exist \u2014 that's beyond even my considerable capabilities.", "waiting": true}
