Let me first check the current state of the demo file and then verify what's happening.I can see the screenshot shows the demo is running. Now let me check both locations of the demo file and see which one is being served:I can see the files are identical between both locations. Let me check which directory the server is actually serving from:Perfect! The server is serving from `/opt/clawd/projects/.preview/`. Now let me check what changes were supposed to be made and take screenshots. Let me first understand what the previous conversation was about by looking at the git status:I see! The preview server file is actually different from the source file. The changes in the source file (in `/opt/clawd/projects/walter_mobile_app/`) haven't been copied to the preview directory. Let me copy the updated file to the preview directory and then take screenshots:Perfect! The file has been updated. Now let me take a screenshot to verify the changes are visible. Let me install a screenshot tool and capture the page:Great! We have Chromium browser. Let me take a screenshot using Chromium's headless mode:Let me try a different approach with better chromium options:Let me try using puppeteer or a simple HTML renderer. First, let me check what's available:Perfect! The file is updated on the server. Now let me use Playwright to take a screenshot:Excellent! Now let me read the screenshot and also create a comparison view:Perfect! I can now see the updated demo page. Now let me scroll down to capture the quote section as well:Good! Now let me scroll down in the conversation to show the quote bubble:Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary document showing what changed:\n\n## Summary\n\n\u2705 **Changes confirmed and deployed!** \n\nI've successfully updated the walter-voice-demo3.html file in the preview server directory.
