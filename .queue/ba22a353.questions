The Android SDK is installed and the `android/` directory exists. Let me check if there's an ongoing build or if it completed.Excellent! The build actually **completed successfully**! The APK has been built and is ready:\n\n**\u2713 APK Location:** `/opt/clawd/projects/walter_mobile_app/walter-voice-app/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`\n**\u2713 Size:** 75MB\n**\u2713 Built:** Feb 13 05:24 (about 20 minutes ago)\n\nThe build didn't lock up - it successfully completed! This is the release APK that you can install on Android devices.Perfect! The APK is valid and ready to use. \n\n**Summary:**\n- \u2705 Android SDK setup complete\n- \u2705 Build completed successfully \n- \u2705 APK generated and verified: `app-release.apk` (75MB)\n- \u2705 Ready to install on Android devices\n\nThe build took about 20 minutes (as expected for the first build) and finished at 05:24. You can now:\n1. Transfer the APK to an Android device\n2. Install it (you'll need to enable \"Install from unknown sources\" in Android settings)\n3. Run the Walter Voice app\n\nWould you like me to help you with the next steps, like testing the APK or making any adjustments to the app?", "waiting": true}
