Executive Summary\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive roadmap for getting the Walter Voice mobile application approved and published on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. It covers the technical requirements, compliance checklist, content policies, estimated timelines, costs, and step-by-step submission process for each platform.\n\n> **Key Takeaway:** With the Expo/React Native architecture already in place, the app can be built for both platforms using EAS Build (Expo Application Services). The primary work to achieve store approval centres on account setup, privacy compliance, content ratings, and meeting each store's specific review guidelines.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
