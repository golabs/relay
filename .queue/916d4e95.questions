Let me first check what you have set up.Great news \u2014 your app **already has full web support built in**. You don't need to build an APK to test it. Here's the situation:\n\n## Your App Can Run in a Browser\n\nYour Expo app has `react-native-web` configured and a production build already in `dist/`. You have two options:\n\n### Option 1: Quick \u2014 Serve the existing web build (fastest)\n\nYou already have a `server.js` and a `dist/` folder with a compiled web app. Let me get it running for you.You already have a compiled web build. Let me deploy it so you can access it right now from your phone.Let me check what the index.html looks like to make sure routing will work properly from a subdirectory.The paths use absolute references (`/manifest.webmanifest`, `/_expo/...`), so it needs to be served from the root, not a subdirectory. Let me deploy it directly as the root of the preview server instead.There's already content at the preview root. The cleanest approach is to serve it via the existing `server.js` which handles SPA routing properly. Let me start that server and also set up a way to make it accessible.The server is running. Now let me also deploy it properly to the preview server so you can access it from your phone via the preview URL.Let me create a proper redirector page and also copy the full app with fixed paths so it works from the preview server.Good, the JS bundle is there (1.5MB). Now let me check if this actually loads properly. But first, let me also look at what the app currently does to understand if there are any API dependencies that would need to work.Good - the app is mostly self-contained UI with simulated auth. Now let me verify the web build actually works by checking it with a quick test.The server is working. Now here's the reality of your situation and the options:\n\n---\n\n## How to Test on Your Phone\n\n### Option A: Expo Go App (Recommended for Quick Testing)\n\nThis is the **easiest way** to test the full React Native app on your phone:\n\n1. **On your phone:** Install **Expo Go** from the Play Store (it's free)\n2. **On this server**, I'd run `npx expo start` which generates a QR code\n3. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go on your phone\n4. You see the **actual React Native app** running natively on your phone - not a web page\n\n**However**, this requires your phone and this server to be on the same network (or use Expo's tunnel mode). Since this is a cloud environment, we'd need tunnel mode.\n\n### Option B: Web App via Preview URL (Works Right Now)\n\nThe app is already compiled for web and running at port 5177. The web version uses `react-native-web` so it renders the **same React components** as the native app \u2014 it's not a separate HTML demo, it's the actual app compiled for browser.\n\nYou can access it at: [http://127.0.0.1:5177/](http://127.0.0.1:5177/)\n\nIf this server is accessible via your Termius connection, you'd use port forwarding to access it on your phone's browser.\n\n### Option C: Build the APK\n\nThis takes ~20 minutes but gives you an installable `.apk` file.\n\n---\n\n### For Termius Specifically\n\nSince you're using **Termius** (SSH client), here's how to get the web app on your phone:\n\n1. **Port Forwarding in Termius**: Set up a local port forward:\n   - Local port: `5177`\n   - Remote host: `127.0.0.1`\n   - Remote port: `5177`\n   \n2. Then open `http://localhost:5177` in your phone's browser\n\n3. The web version looks and behaves like the native app \u2014 same screens, same animations, same navigation flow (Login \u2192 Voice \u2192 Transcript)\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Try starting Expo with tunnel mode** so you can use Expo Go on your phone (full native experience)?\n2. **Rebuild the web version** if it's out of date (the current build may be stale)?\n3. **Build the APK** (~20 min) for a true native test?", "waiting": true}
