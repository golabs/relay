Let me look at the new screenshots to see the remaining issues.I can see the remaining issues:

1. **Screenshot 1 (Domain Management)**: "Add Domain" button is bleeding off the right edge, "WALTER Dev" text is cut off
2. **Screenshot 2 (Claims)**: "New Claim" button looks fine, but the page title "Claims" is partially hidden behind the hamburger menu
3. **Screenshot 3 (Quotes)**: "Search by p..." is cut off, "Pending Acceptance" badge is bleeding right
4. **Screenshot 4 (Tasks)**: Status filter buttons "in progress" and "com..." are bleeding off the right, "low" button cut off

Let me fix them one by one:Now fix the Claims page header:Now fix the Tasks page filter buttons:Now let me fix the QuoteHistoryV2 page which shows the "Search by p..." that's cut off:Now let me run the build to make sure everything compiles:All fixes have been applied and the build succeeded.
