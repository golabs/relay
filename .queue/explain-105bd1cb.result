## What This File Does

This CLAUDE.md file is like a "quick start guide" or "instruction manual" for a project called "skynet." It's a special file that tells an AI assistant (Claude) how to work with this specific project - think of it like leaving notes for a helper so they know exactly what to do when they work on your project.

## Key Components

**Project Title & Instructions Header**: The file starts by identifying itself as instructions for the "skynet" project, making it clear this is guidance specifically for that project.

**Project Overview Section**: This is meant to be a brief description of what the project does - like the "About" section on a website. However, it's currently empty with just a placeholder saying "Add project description here."

**Key Directories Section**: This is like a map showing where important files are stored:
- `src/` folder contains the actual program code (the "source code")
- `.claude/` folder contains special commands and skills that the AI assistant can use

**Running the Project Section**: This would normally contain step-by-step instructions for how to start or use the project, but it's currently empty with a placeholder.

## How It Works

Think of this file like a recipe card that's been started but not finished. When an AI assistant like Claude looks at a project, it first reads this CLAUDE.md file to understand what the project is about and how to work with it. The file follows a standard template format, but in this case, most of the important information hasn't been filled in yet - it's just the skeleton or outline of what should be there.

## Important Things to Know

- This file is essentially **incomplete** - it's a template waiting to be customized with actual project details
- The structure shows this is meant to be a **software project** (indicated by the `src/` folder for source code)
- The `.claude/` folder suggests this project is designed to work with AI assistants and has special AI-powered features
- Without the missing information filled in, someone trying to use or understand this project would have a hard time knowing what it does or how to use it
