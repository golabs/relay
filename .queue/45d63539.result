That's a quick one - let me check the send button and add a tooltip directly.The send button already has a tooltip (`title="Send message"`). Let me check if you want something more descriptive - perhaps including the keyboard shortcut:The send button already has `title="Send message"`. I'll enhance it to include the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter) which is more helpful:Done. The send button tooltip now shows **"Send message (Ctrl+Enter)"** so users know the keyboard shortcut.

Quick change - no orchestration needed for a one-liner. The button already had a basic tooltip; I enhanced it with the keyboard shortcut hint.
