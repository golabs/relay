I'll follow the EXPLAIN workflow. First, let me read the required files in order.Now let me run the preflight checks automatically.Pre-flight check found TypeScript errors. Let me run the backend checks separately and then address the issues.I am in **EXPLAIN_ONLY** mode.

**Files read:** WORKFLOW.md, CLAUDE.md, lessons.md, TASK.md
**Pre-flight:** ❌ FAILED - TypeScript errors exist in both frontend and backend

The codebase has existing TypeScript errors that need to be fixed before we can proceed with the mobile responsive design task. However, per the workflow, I should focus on the **current task** (mobile responsiveness) and spawn sub-agents to gather data.

Let me clear the output files and spawn sub-agents to explore the codebase for mobile-related patterns.Now let me spawn sub-agents to explore the codebase for mobile-related patterns and the current screen implementations.Excellent! I have comprehensive findings from both sub-agents. Let me update the todo list and compile the full analysis into OUTPUT.md.---

## I am in EXPLAIN_ONLY mode.

**Files read:** WORKFLOW.md, CLAUDE.md, lessons.md, TASK.md, OUTPUT.md, QUESTIONS.md
**Pre-flight:** ⚠️ TypeScript errors exist (pre-existing, unrelated to this task)

**Sub-agents spawned:**
1. **Explore** - Found existing responsive patterns, identified 7 screens, analyzed current mobile support
2. **Explore (Walter)** - Found Walter project mobile implementation patterns to follow

**Progress tracking:** ✅ All analysis tasks completed

## Summary

The analysis is complete. Here's what was discovered:

### Current State
- HubAI already has **partial mobile support** with Tailwind responsive classes
- Header has a bottom mobile nav bar (lines 254-281)
- Most screens have `md:` and `lg:` breakpoints but minimal `sm:` coverage
- **Gaps:** Sidebar doesn't collapse on mobile, tables can overflow, two-panel layouts don't stack

### Walter Reference
Found the Walter project at `/opt/clawd/projects/walter-ai/` with proven mobile patterns:
- `use-mobile.tsx` hook for viewport detection
- Sheet-based hamburger menu
- `ml-0 md:ml-16` layout pattern for responsive sidebar margin

### Implementation Plan (7 Files to Modify)
1. Create `use-mobile` hook
2. Update Layout for responsive sidebar margin
3. Add hamburger menu to DashboardSidebar
4. Fix notification overflow in Header
5. Add overflow wrapper to Table component
6. Stack TasksWorkflowScreen panels on mobile
7. Create Playwright mobile tests

### Questions for You (see QUESTIONS.md)
1. Keep bottom nav OR replace with hamburger menu?
2. How should two-panel screens display on mobile (stack vs tabs)?
3. Which viewport sizes to prioritize (320px, 375px, 414px)?

**Plan written to:** `.claude/OUTPUT.md`
**Questions written to:** `.claude/QUESTIONS.md`

After implementation is complete, I will AUTOMATICALLY:
1. Run `/validate` (fix any issues)
2. Run `/code-review` (fix any issues)
3. Run `/commit` (commit and push)
4. Display EXECUTION SUMMARY with workflow status

**Say "Proceed with implementation"** when ready (optionally answer the questions first).
