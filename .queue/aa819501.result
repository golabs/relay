Let me look at the uploaded images and the current codebase to understand what needs to change.I can see:
1. **Image 1**: The Walter Voice screen with a small Walter "W" logo icon circled in red at the bottom-right
2. **Image 2**: A new icon - a grid of dots (3x3+1 pattern) inside a purple circle that should replace it

Let me find the Voice screen code and understand the current icon setup.Let me read the voice screen file directly to see the full layout and find that bottom-right icon.Now I can see the full picture. Looking at the screenshot, the circled icon at the bottom-right is the **keypad button** (line 211-216) - it uses `Ionicons name="keypad"` which renders as the small Walter-like icon at the bottom-right. 

The user wants to:
1. **Center** this icon (currently it's part of a row with mic button and transcript toggle)
2. **Replace** it with the new dots-grid icon from the second image

Let me first save the new icon image, then make the changes.Now let me look more carefully at the screenshot. The circled icon at the bottom-right appears to be a small Walter "W" logo in a circle - that's the keypad button. Looking at the bottom controls, there are 3 items: mic button, transcript toggle, and the keypad button.

The user wants to:
1. **Replace** the keypad icon (bottom-right) with the new dots-grid icon from image 2
2. **Center** it (instead of being part of the row on the right side)

Let me update the voice screen. I'll replace the keypad button's Ionicons icon with the new image and center the bottom controls.Wait - looking at the screenshot more carefully, I think the user wants the icon **centered** at the bottom, not off to the right. Let me re-read the request: "The icon circled can we center and replace with the icon attached second pic."

So the user wants the circled icon (the keypad/Walter button at bottom-right) to be:
1. **Centered** at the bottom of the screen
2. **Replaced** with the new dots-grid icon

Let me restructure the bottom controls to center the dialpad icon. I'll move the mic and transcript toggle elsewhere or make the dialpad the central focus.

Actually, looking again at the screenshot - the bottom controls area has the mic, transcript toggle, and keypad button in a row. The keypad button (circled) is on the right. The user wants it centered. The simplest interpretation is to center that specific icon button at the bottom, potentially removing or repositioning the other controls, or just making the dialpad icon the centered element.

Let me restructure the bottom controls to center the dialpad icon:Now let me add the styles for the new centered dialpad:Now I need to move the existing bottom controls up a bit so they don't overlap with the new centered dialpad icon:Now let me build the APK to test. Let me verify the file looks correct first.The code looks good. Now let me build the APK.The build is running in the background (takes several minutes). Let me verify the changes are correct while it builds.

Here's a summary of what I changed in `/opt/clawd/projects/walter_mobile_app/walter-voice-app/app/voice.tsx`:

1. **Separated the keypad icon** from the bottom controls row (mic + transcript toggle) into its own centered container
2. **Replaced the Ionicons `keypad` icon** with the new dots-grid icon image (`dialpad-icon.png`) from your second screenshot
3. **Centered** the new icon at the bottom of the screen using a new `dialpadContainer` with `alignItems: 'center'`
4. **Moved the mic + transcript controls up** (from `bottom: 40` to `bottom: 110`) so they sit above the centered dialpad icon

Layout is now:
- **Middle row**: Mic button + Transcript toggle (centered)
- **Bottom center**: New dots-grid icon (centered, at bottom)

Let me check on the build progress.The build failed because the `.jpg` file was saved with a `.png` extension, and Android's AAPT resource compiler rejected it. Let me convert it properly to PNG format.Confirmed - it's actually a JPEG. Let me convert it to proper PNG.Good, it's a proper PNG now. Let me rebuild.Build successful! Let me verify the APK exists.Build successful. APK is at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (75MB).

Here's what I changed:

1. **Replaced** the keypad icon (bottom-right, circled in your screenshot) with your new dots-grid icon image
2. **Centered** it at the bottom of the screen in its own container (`dialpadContainer` with `alignItems: 'center'`)
3. **Moved the mic + transcript toggle row** up slightly (to `bottom: 110`) so it sits above the new centered icon

The layout is now:
- Row with mic button + transcript toggle (centered, higher up)
- New dots-grid icon (centered at the very bottom)
