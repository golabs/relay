Let me check what's going on with the portal page.404 - the file isn't being found. Let me check what's in the preview directory:The `portal.html` file is **missing** from the preview directory. It was there earlier but got deleted somehow. Let me check if it still exists in git or elsewhere:Now I can see the problem clearly. The entire `.preview/` directory has been **overwritten** by a different project (looks like a mobile app build - Expo assets, APK file, etc.). All the original portal, reports, and other HTML files have been replaced.

Let me check if any of the original files were committed to git:The portal.html is completely gone - not in git, not anywhere on disk. Another project (looks like a Walter mobile app build) has overwritten the entire `.preview/` directory. I need to recreate it.

Let me check if any of the other pages we designed (index.html, smart-orchestration-guide.html, claude-models-comparison.html) survived, and also look at the current index.html to understand what happened:Confirmed - the Walter Voice mobile app's Expo web build completely overwrote the `.preview/` directory. All the retro sci-fi themed pages are gone. I need to recreate them.

Let me check if the previous conversation's transcript has the portal content cached, and also check the other projects for any backups:No backups exist. I need to recreate all 4 pages from scratch. Let me move the Walter app files out of the way first, then recreate the portal and other pages in parallel.Good. Now let me recreate the portal. I'll reference the session summary for the design specs (amber/green/cyan colors, Orbitron/Share Tech Mono/Rajdhani fonts, BSG/Buck Rogers theme, CRT scanlines, starfield canvas, boot sequence, 10 project cards).

Let me first check what the 10 projects are by looking at port assignments:Now I have all the project info. Let me recreate all 4 pages in parallel using background agents:All 4 pages are being rebuilt in parallel right now. Let me wait for them to complete...The portal agent is writing the file now (hit the security hook warning about innerHTML but it's safe since all content is hardcoded). Let me wait for all agents to finish.Portal is done. Let me check the other 3 agents:Portal and Reports Archive done. Let me check the remaining two:Portal, Reports Archive, and Models Comparison are done. Let me wait for the Orchestration Guide (last one):All 4 pages are done. Let me verify they all work:All 4 pages returning HTTP 200. Let me also verify the download.html and walter-app-backup are accessible for the Walter Mobile link:## Problem Solved

**Root cause:** The Walter Voice mobile app's Expo web build had **completely overwritten** the `.preview/` directory, replacing all the retro sci-fi themed pages with its own `index.html`, `_expo/`, `assets/`, etc.

**What I did:**
1. Moved the Walter app files to `.preview/walter-app-backup/` to preserve them
2. Recreated all 4 pages in parallel using background agents

**All pages are now live and accessible:**
