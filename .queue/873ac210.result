I see the QUESTIONS.md file still has unanswered questions. Before I can proceed, I need your input on these design decisions:

## Questions Requiring Answers

**Q1: Mobile Navigation Approach**
Should we keep the existing bottom mobile navigation bar OR replace it with a hamburger menu like Walter?

- **A)** Keep bottom nav (users familiar with mobile apps)
- **B)** Replace with hamburger menu (consistent with Walter)
- **C)** Use both (hamburger for sidebar items, bottom nav for main actions)

---

**Q2: Two-Panel Screen Layout (TasksWorkflowScreen)**
How should the InsuredListPanel and ClaimsByInsuredPanel display on mobile?

- **A)** Stack vertically (Insured list on top, Policies below)
- **B)** Use tabs (Tab 1: Insured List, Tab 2: Policies)
- **C)** Show only one panel with toggle button

**Q3: Mobile Viewport Testing Priority**
Which viewport sizes should we prioritize?

- **A)** All three (320px, 375px, 414px)
- **B)** Focus on 375px (most common)

Please answer these questions, then say **"Proceed with implementation"** when ready.

The full implementation plan is in `.claude/OUTPUT.md` - ready for your review.
