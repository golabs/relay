Let me look at the screenshot to see the issue.I can see the issue - the operation cards are still bleeding over the right edge. The text in the cards like "Retrieve a paginated list of all claims with optional filt..." is getting cut off. The cards themselves extend to the edge without proper padding.

Let me check the operations partial template and add proper box-sizing and width constraints:The issue is that the operation cards and the container need proper width constraints. Let me look at the current mobile CSS and fix the overflow issue more aggressively:The CSS looks correct for single column on mobile. The issue is likely that the container doesn't have proper width constraints or there's a parent element causing overflow. Let me add more comprehensive fixes:Now let me also check and fix the main content area to ensure it respects the viewport width:The main-content has max-width and overflow-x hidden, but let me add box-sizing and width constraints:Now let me test with Playwright on mobile viewport:The layout now looks correct on mobile - all cards fit within the viewport without horizontal overflow. The text content wraps properly and the cards don't bleed over the right edge.

Let me take a scrolled screenshot to verify:The mobile layout is now fixed. The cards are properly contained within the viewport:

- All operation cards fit within the screen width
- Text content wraps properly (no bleeding over the edge)
- The header shows "INSUREI" with "ONLINE" status badge properly aligned
- Cards have proper padding and don't overflow

The fixes applied:
1. Added `box-sizing: border-box` to all containers and cards
2. Added `width: 100%` and `max-width: 100%` constraints
3. Added `overflow: hidden` to operation cards
4. Ensured search box and input elements are properly constrained
