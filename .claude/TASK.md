# Looking at the relay codebase and git history, I can help

## Description

Looking at the relay codebase and git history, I can help you revert the smart send changes. Based on the recent commits, I can see that smart send functionality was added in recent updates.

There are two options available:

**Option 1: Selective Revert (Recommended)**
Remove only the smart send feature while keeping other improvements (Git features, skills panel, video transcription, UI enhancements). This would involve:
- Removing smart send UI elements from the templates
- Removing smart send logic from the backend
- Keeping all other features intact

**Option 2: Full Revert**
Revert to a commit before smart send was introduced, which would remove all recent changes including:
- Smart send functionality
- Git branch management
- Skills panel enhancements
- Video transcription features
- Recent UI improvements

Both options are technically feasible. Option 1 is cleaner and preserves useful features that aren't related to smart send. Option 2 is simpler but loses more functionality.

Which approach would you prefer?
