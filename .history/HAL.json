Let me start by investigating the agent system.Now let me get some additional details by reading the key files directly to ensure I have the complete picture.Now let me read the base agent class and the orchestrator to complete the picture.Now I have all the information needed. Let me create a comprehensive report on all the agents in HAL.I've created a comprehensive interactive report. Here's a detailed summary of all **6 agents** in the HAL system:\n\n---\n\n## HAL Agent System - Complete Breakdown\n\n### Overview\nThe HAL system has **6 active agents** (with 7 registered types since `cargo_group` has an alias `risk_modifier`):\n- **4 Database-Driven Agents** - Rule-based, deterministic calculations from DB tables\n- **2 AI-Powered Agents** - Azure OpenAI integration for intelligent analysis\n\n---\n\n## Agent Details\n\n### 1. Rating Agent (Priority: 10)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | Database-driven |\n| **File** | `src/agents/implementations/rating.ts` (169 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Calculates base insurance rate from sum insured bands |\n| **Tables Used** | `SumInsuredRateBand` |\n| **Output** | `baseRate` (percentage), `bandNumber`, `includesWSRCC` |\n| **Confidence** | 95% (direct match), 85% (fallback) |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Cargo Group Agent (Priority: 20)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | Database-driven |\n| **File** | `src/agents/implementations/cargo-group.ts` (341 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Determines cargo classification and rate loading multiplier |\n| **Tables Used** | `CargoGroup`, `HSCode`, `HSChapter` |\n| **Output** | `rateLoadingMultiplier`, `cargoGroupNumber`, `minExcess`, `minPremium` |\n| **Matching Strategy** | 4-level fallback: HS commodity (98%) \u2192 Pattern (92%) \u2192 Chapter (80%) \u2192 Default (60%) |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Geography Agent (Priority: 30)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | Database-driven |\n| **File** | `src/agents/implementations/geography.ts` (360 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Calculates geographic risk loading based on voyage route |\n| **Tables Used** | `Country`, `InternationalRiskGroup`, `CountryRiskAssignment`, `DomesticVoyageLoading` |\n| **Output** | `geographyLoadingMultiplier`, `isDomestic`, `loadingBreakdown` |\n| **Logic** | Domestic (AU/NZ) uses DomesticVoyageLoading; International uses MAX of origin/destination risk groups |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Claims History Agent (Priority: 40)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | Database-driven |\n| **File** | `src/agents/implementations/claims-history.ts` (332 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Calculates claims experience loading from historical loss ratio |\n| **Tables Used** | `ClaimsExperienceLoading` |\n| **Output** | `claimsLoadingMultiplier`, `credibilityFactor`, `lossRatioPercent` |\n| **Special** | Credibility weighting: 60% years-of-history + 40% premium volume; Full credibility at 5+ years & $500k+ |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Market Intelligence Agent (Priority: 50)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | AI-Powered (Azure OpenAI) |\n| **Files** | `src/agents/implementations/market-intelligence.ts` (167 lines), `ai-base.ts` (340 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Analyzes market conditions, cargo vulnerabilities, route risks |\n| **Services** | Azure OpenAI, AI Cache (`src/services/openai.ts`, `src/services/ai-cache.ts`) |\n| **Output** | `marketLoadingMultiplier` (-20% to +50%), `marketCondition`, `opportunityScore`, `riskFactors` |\n| **Analysis Factors** | Piracy, weather, congestion, theft/damage/spoilage, soft/hard market, seasonal patterns |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Arbiter Agent (Priority: 100 - Last)\n| Aspect | Details |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Type** | AI-Powered Final Decision |\n| **File** | `src/agents/implementations/arbiter.ts` (234 lines) |\n| **Purpose** | Synthesizes all agent outputs into final pricing recommendation |\n| **Output** | `arbiterLoadingMultiplier` (\u00b15% max), `finalRecommendedRate`, `profitabilityScore`, `competitivenessScore`, `riskScore` |\n| **Decisions** | APPROVED, APPROVED_WITH_ADJUSTMENTS, REQUIRES_REFERRAL, DECLINED |\n| **Referral Triggers** | Any confidence < 60%, loadings > 50%, premium > $50k, agent conflicts |\n\n---\n\n## Core Infrastructure Files\n\n| File | Lines | Purpose |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| `src/agents/types.ts` | 323 | Type definitions (AgentType, AgentDecision, PricingResult, IAgent) |\n| `src/agents/base.ts` | 525 | Abstract BaseAgent with retry logic, timeout handling, event publishing |\n| `src/agents/factory.ts` | 347 | Singleton factory for agent creation, caching, hot-reload |\n| `src/agents/orchestrator.ts` | 630 | Multi-agent orchestration with parallel execution by priority |\n| `src/agents/implementations/index.ts` | 49 | Agent registration (maps types to implementations) |\n\n---\n\n## Execution Flow\n```\nAPI Request \u2192 Load Agents by Priority \u2192 Execute in Parallel Groups:\n  Priority 10: RatingAgent (base rate)\n  Priority 20: CargoGroupAgent (loading)\n  Priority 30: GeographyAgent (loading)  \n  Priority 40: ClaimsHistoryAgent (loading)\n  Priority 50: MarketIntelligenceAgent (AI adjustment)\n  Priority 100: ArbiterAgent (final decision)\n\u2192 Aggregate: baseRate \u00d7 all multipliers \u2192 Store & Return\n```\n\n---\n\n**View the interactive report:** [http://127.0.0.1:8800/hal-agents-report.html](http://127.0.0.1:8800/hal-agents-report.html)", "timestamp": 1770372643.733}, {"user": "the client does not want me to have the HAL project on here can you remove it just file folder and files please HAL only\n\n---\n[AGENT MODE: Quick] Simple task - use haiku model if available for speed.

The **HAL project has already been removed**. The bash errors we're seeing are because we were previously working in the `/opt/clawd/projects/HAL` directory when it was deleted, which caused the shell to lose its working directory.\n\nThe HAL project folder and all its files are **already gone** from your system.
