      "assistant": "Done. The Brett pane now has its own model selector dropdown next to the Voice button. Both selectors (header and Brett pane) stay in sync - changing one updates the other. The preference is also saved to localStorage so it persists between sessions.",

      "assistant": "Done. I made two fixes:\n\n1. **Response stays visible**: After a response completes, it now selects that specific message (`selectedHistoryIndex = chatHistory.length - 1`) so it stays prominently displayed with the \"\u2190 Back to all\" button, instead of immediately jumping to the full history view.\n\n2. **Removed weird characters**: Replaced all HTML entity codes (like `&#128218;`, `&#129302;`, etc.) with actual Unicode emoji characters (\ud83d\udcda, \ud83e\udd16, \ud83d\udde3, \ud83d\udd0a, \ud83d\uddd1, \ud83c\udfa4, \ud83d\udce4, \ud83d\udcce, \ud83d\udd34, \u2039, \u2190).\n\nYou'll need to restart the relay server for the changes to take effect.",

      "assistant": "Server is running. Now whenever I edit `chat-relay.py`, the server will automatically restart. You can just refresh your browser to get the changes.\n\n**What's set up:**\n- `server-watcher.py` monitors `chat-relay.py` for changes\n- When the file is modified, it automatically kills and restarts the server\n- Also auto-restarts if the server crashes unexpectedly\n- Just refresh your browser after builds - no manual restart needed",
