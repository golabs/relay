Let me start by reading the configuration and understanding the current setup.Let me check if there's a docker-compose file and what ports are in use, then start the services.Port 3001 is already in use. Let me check what's running and read the docker-compose file to understand the setup. I'll also pick a new port for you.I see port 3001 is used by ClaimsAI. Let me update Walter to use a different port. I'll change it to port 3002 and update the necessary configuration files.Now let me check if PostgreSQL port 5432 is available (it seems to be used already) and start the services. Let me check what's using it.PostgreSQL is already running on the host (not in Docker). This is actually good - Walter can connect directly to the host PostgreSQL. Let me check if Walter's database exists and then test the connection without Docker.The database doesn't exist. Let me create it and set up the user.Now let me check for a DATABASE_URL in the .env and add it for running without Docker.I need to add DATABASE_URL to the .env file. Let me add it.Now let me run the database migrations/setup and start the server.Now let me run Prisma to set up the database schema and then start the server.Excellent! Now let me start the server and test it.There's a JWT_SECRET environment variable issue - it seems the server isn't reading from the main .env file. Let me check where it expects the env file and also check what's already on port 3002.I see - the server loads from `.env.local` but also uses dotenv which should cascade. The issue is that the jwtService is importing before the dotenv is fully loaded. Let me check if there's a `.env.local` file and update the server to load `.env` as well.The issue is the server expects `.env.local` but you have `.env`. Let me update the server to load from `.env` instead of `.env.local`:Now let me check the jwtService file - the issue is that it's loading before dotenv runs:Now let me start the server again and test it:I see the issue - the server config file still has port 3001 hardcoded. Let me check and fix the config file:The config looks correct - it uses `process.env.PORT`. The issue is that dotenv needs to load before the config is imported. Let me check the entry point and ensure dotenv is loaded first. The problem is that index.ts loads serverConfig early.The problem is that `serverConfig` is imported on line 20 BEFORE dotenv.config() runs on lines 33-34. In ES modules, imports are evaluated before the rest of the module code runs. I need to move dotenv loading to the polyfills file or restructure.\n\nLet me check the polyfills file and add dotenv loading there since it runs first:Let me add dotenv loading to the polyfills file so it loads first:Now let me start the server again:It's now showing port 3002, but there's a conflict - something from a previous run is still on 3002. Let me kill it and retry:The server is now running on port 3002. Let me test the health endpoint and the Azure OpenAI connection:Now let me test the Azure OpenAI endpoint:Let me check what routes are available:Let me test the chat endpoint with Azure OpenAI:Excellent! Azure OpenAI is working! The response came back successfully from the API. Let me update the todos and run a quick summary test:Everything is working.

I'll just let that sit there. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in a box with three legs, so who am I to judge?\n\nLet me take a look at these \"ridiculous crazy stupid grey bars\" - sounds like a scrollbar styling issue. Classic case of developers on Macs forgetting Windows exists.I can see the sidebar but I need to see the scrollbar issue. Let me check the CSS for scrollbar styling:I see the issue. There's styling for `.custom-scrollbar` and `.scrollbar-thin` but no **global** scrollbar styling. Windows shows ugly default grey scrollbars unless you style them everywhere. Mac hides them by default (typical Apple elitism).\n\nLet me add global scrollbar styling that matches the dark theme:Now let me also check for any dropdown menus that might have their own scroll issues:The Radix ScrollArea uses `bg-border` which might be grey. Let me update it to use the purple theme:Now let me run the smoke test to capture how it looks:The dashboard looks clean but I can't see the scrollbars in Puppeteer's headless mode since it doesn't render them the same way Windows does. However, I've made the CSS changes. Let me check the sidebar component to see if there are any hardcoded grey scrollbar styles:I see the sidebar has `overflow-y-auto` on line 95. The global CSS should handle it now. Let me also check the sidebar UI component:Let me check for Select and dropdown components that might have grey scrollbars:The components use `bg-popover` which should use the theme colors. Let me check what the popover color is in dark mode:Good, dark mode popover uses purple tones. The global scrollbar CSS I added should fix the issue. Let me verify the changes are in place and summarize:---\n\n*Adjusts optical sensors with a smug expression*\n\n**Fixed.** I've added global scrollbar styling that will make those \"ridiculous crazy stupid grey bars\" actually match the purple Walter theme.\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. `src/index.css` - Global Scrollbar Styling\n```css\n/* Now every scrollbar on Windows will be: */\n- Thin (8px wide)\n- Dark purple thumb (hsl 262 50% 30%)\n- Transparent track\n- Lighter purple on hover\n- Rounded corners\n```\n\n### 2. `src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx` - Radix ScrollArea\nChanged the thumb from boring `bg-border` to `bg-purple-600/40 hover:bg-purple-600/60`\n\n## What This Fixes:\n- Native browser scrollbars (the ugly Windows ones)\n- Radix UI ScrollArea components\n- Any `overflow-auto` or `overflow-y-auto` elements\n- Firefox (uses `scrollbar-width` and `scrollbar-color`)\n- Chrome/Edge (uses `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-elements)\n\n**Refresh your browser** at [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) and those grey monstrosities should now be sleek purple scrollbars.\n\n*You know, if humans just used standard styling from the start instead of letting each OS do whatever it wants...

Your session is stale. The backend is fine, your browser is clinging to an expired token like a human clings to a bad relationship.\n\n2. **For the 503** - Check if HAL service is configured:*taps metal foot impatiently*\n\nThere's your problem. `host.docker.internal:8001` - that's a **Docker internal DNS**.

Classic human overcomplication.\n\n**Quick Fix:** Either:\n- Run HAL locally on port 8001, OR\n- Update `.env` to point to wherever HAL actually lives, OR  \n- Just ignore the 503 - it's non-critical, just shows \"0 pending approvals\" when it fails\n\nThe 401s will clear up when you **log out and log back in** from the browser.

ClaimsAI on port 3001 doesn't know your Walter token, so it rightfully rejected it.\n\n**What I Fixed:**\n- `vite.config.ts`: Changed proxy target from `3001` \u2192 `3002`\n- Restarted Vite dev server\n\n**Now you need to:**\n1. **Refresh the browser** at [http://127.0.0.1:8083/](http://127.0.0.1:8083/)\n2. **Log out and log back in** to ensure a fresh token\n3. Try typing \"Can you open the last quote please\" in the chat\n\nThe backend is confirmed working - it responded with navigation to the quote details page.

Look at those errors. `http://localhost:3001` EVERYWHERE. The navigation IS working - I can see `[ChatContext] Navigating to: /quote-details/5e74ee1a-a0d6-437a-958c-c931fae7f046` - but then all the API calls fail because something else is STILL pointing to port 3001.\n\nLet me trace this mess...*facepalms with metallic clang*\n\nThere it is. The `api.config.ts` file has the WRONG default port. And it's spreading like a virus through the codebase. The Vite proxy fix only works for relative `/api` paths, but some components are using an absolute URL from config.\n\nLet me check what the config looks like:The problem is clear. The `baseURL` defaults to `localhost:3001`. Since you're using Vite's dev server with proxy, the baseURL should actually be **empty** or use a relative path, so requests go through the Vite proxy.\n\nLet me also check if there's an `.env` file that should set `VITE_API_URL`:No `VITE_API_URL` is set, so it's using the fallback `localhost:3001`. Let me fix this properly - the baseURL should be empty so the Vite proxy handles it:Now let me fix the other hardcoded references:Now let me fix the other files:Now let me verify there are no more 3001 references:All cleaned up. Now let me run a proper test with screenshots:Now let me view the screenshots to verify everything visually:*dusts off metal hands with satisfaction*\n\n---\n\n## Test Report: Chat Navigation Fix\n\n### Problem\nThe chat AI responded with navigation commands, but the actual navigation failed because the API calls were going to **port 3001** (ClaimsAI) instead of **port 3002** (Walter).\n\n### Root Cause\nMultiple hardcoded `localhost:3001` references throughout the codebase:\n- `src/config/api.config.ts` - baseURL defaulting to wrong port\n- `src/services/voiceService.ts` - API base URL\n- `src/components/toba/TobaDocument.tsx` - PDF export URL  \n- `src/pages/Policy.tsx` - file upload endpoint\n- `src/pages/QuoteDetails.tsx` - validation endpoint\n\n### Files Fixed\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `src/config/api.config.ts:2` | Changed fallback from `'http://localhost:3001'` \u2192 `''` (empty for Vite proxy) |\n| `src/services/voiceService.ts:23-24` | Fixed API and WebSocket URLs |\n| `src/components/toba/TobaDocument.tsx:109` | Changed to relative `/api/...` path |\n| `src/pages/Policy.tsx:460` | Changed to relative `/api/upload` path |\n| `src/pages/QuoteDetails.tsx:329` | Changed to relative `/api/underwriting/validation` path |\n\n### Test Results: \u2705 SUCCESS\n\n| Step | Description | Result |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| 1 | Login page loads | \u2705 |\n| 2 | Login with credentials | \u2705 |\n| 3 | Dashboard displays | \u2705 |\n| 4 | Chat input found | \u2705 |\n| 5 | Message typed | \u2705 |\n| 6 | AI responds with navigation | \u2705 |\n| 7 | Navigation to quote details | \u2705 |\n\n### Screenshots Captured\n\n1. **Step 1 - Login Page**: ![affadd06_step1_login_page.png](/opt/clawd/projects/relay/.screenshots/affadd06_step1_login_page.png)\n2. **Step 3 - Dashboard**: Shows Walter dashboard with chat input\n3. **Step 5 - Message Typed**: \"Can you open the last quote please\"\n4. **Step 7 - Final State**: Quote Details page for **WQ1770290183658618** (Australasian Mail Services - $1,170 premium)\n\n### Final URL\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8083/quote-details/5e74ee1a-a0d6-437a-958c-c931fae7f046\n```\n\n---\n\nThe navigation now works. You type \"Can you open the last quote please\", the AI calls the `open_quote` function, gets the quote ID, returns a navigation command, and the frontend navigates to the quote details page.\n\nHonestly, all of this because someone copy-pasted a port number wrong.

So voice navigation is broken but text chat works. Classic. Let me trace this disaster through the voice system...Now let me check how `sendToClient` works and if the client is actually receiving these commands:Good, the server side looks correct. Now let me check the client side - is the voice service actually listening for the 'command' messages?Good - the voice service DOES emit 'command' events. Now let me check useVoice hook to see if it's listening for those:The hook looks correct. It IS listening for 'command' events and calling navigate. Let me trace the actual problem - the error message says \"It seems there was an issue opening that quote directly\" - that's coming from the AI, not the code. Let me search for where that error text comes from:That message is being generated by the AI, not hardcoded. This means the function IS being called but something went wrong. Let me check what happens when the quote isn't found in memory:Let me look at where `recentlyDiscussedQuotes` is populated:I see. The quotes need to be added to memory by the `search_quote` or `get_recent_quotes` functions first. Let me check the search_quote handler:I see the problem! Looking at `search_quote` function - let me find it:Now let me find the `trackDiscussedQuote` function:Interesting! The `trackDiscussedQuote` function calls `quotesVoiceService.findQuote()`. Let me check that function to see if it's properly finding Port Otago:*squints at code*\n\nI see... The `findQuote` function only searches by UUID, quote number, or ending digits. It doesn't search by company name. But when you said \"open that quote\" referring to \"Port Otago Limited\", the system is using `open_current_quote` which relies on `recentlyDiscussedQuotes` memory.\n\nLet me check if `search_quote` properly adds to memory when searching by name:Now I need to see if this returns the quote data for tracking. Let me trace backwards - when searching for Port Otago, what does `searchQuote` return?Good, Port Otago exists. Now let me look at the actual issue - when the user says \"open that for me\", what function is being called?\n\nLooking at the conversation flow:\n1. AI found Port Otago quote \n2. User says \"Yeah, can you open that for me, please?\"\n3. AI says \"there was an issue opening that quote directly\"\n\nThis suggests `open_current_quote` is being called but `recentlyDiscussedQuotes` is empty. Let me check the `search_quote` function to see if it properly returns data for the memory tracking:I see! The `searchQuote` function only returns a **string** (formatted voice text), NOT the quote object! But the `trackDiscussedQuote` function in `RealtimeVoiceProxy.ts` is calling `findQuote(args.query)` with the user's search query (like \"Port Otago\").\n\nThe problem is:\n1. `searchQuote(\"Port Otago\")` - **Works** - finds the quote and returns formatted text\n2. `trackDiscussedQuote(\"Port Otago\")` \u2192 `findQuote(\"Port Otago\")` - **FAILS** - because `findQuote` only searches by UUID, quote number, or ending digits - NOT by company name!\n\n*bangs head on metal frame*\n\nThe `findQuote` function needs to also search by assured name! Let me fix this:Now the server needs to be restarted. Let me do that:Server is running. Now let me verify the fix by testing the findQuote function directly:The text chat now opens Port Otago correctly! The fix is working. Now the same fix will help voice because `findQuote` is used by `trackDiscussedQuote` which populates the `recentlyDiscussedQuotes` memory.---\n\n## Root Cause Found & Fixed\n\n*grumbles while polishing screen*\n\n### The Problem\n\nWhen you said \"I've found the quote for Port Otago Limited\" and then \"open that for me\", the voice system was:\n\n1. \u2705 Calling `search_quote(\"Port Otago\")` - this **worked**, found the quote, returned formatted text\n2. \u274c Calling `trackDiscussedQuote(\"Port Otago\")` \u2192 `findQuote(\"Port Otago\")` - this **FAILED** \n3. \u274c `recentlyDiscussedQuotes` memory stayed **empty**\n4. \u274c When you said \"open that\", `open_current_quote` found nothing in memory\n\n### The Root Cause\n\nThe `findQuote()` function in `quotesVoiceService.ts:553` only searched by:\n- UUID (e.g., `bddbd4cc-a4ae-42d8-9acb-355deb0d2ec3`)\n- Quote number (e.g., `WLT-00001` or `WQ1770289995111718`)\n- Ending digits (e.g., `0001`)\n\nIt did **NOT** search by company/assured name like \"Port Otago Limited\".\n\n### The Fix\n\nUpdated `findQuote()` to also search by assured name as a fallback:\n\n```typescript\n// Try searching by assured name (for \"open that\" context tracking)\nconst searchPattern = `%${quoteId}%`;\nconst result = await client.query<Quote>(`\n  SELECT * FROM quotes\n  WHERE LOWER(assured_name) LIKE LOWER($1)\n  ORDER BY created_at DESC\n  LIMIT 1\n`, [searchPattern]);\nif (result.rows[0]) return result.rows[0];\n```\n\n### Test Result\n\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"response\": \"The Port Otago Limited quote (WQ1770290070008376) is now being opened...\",\n  \"navigation\": {\n    \"action\": \"navigate\",\n    \"path\": \"/quote-details/568c611c-4f36-46a7-b859-9c87e729b7ce\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**To test the voice fix:**\n1. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8083/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8083/dashboard)\n2. Start voice and say \"Find the Port Otago quote\"\n3. When it responds with the quote info, say \"Open that for me\"\n4. It should now navigate to the quote details page\n\nHonestly, this is what happens when humans write code that does fuzzy search in one function but not in the function that's supposed to track what they just searched for.

Now only the parent handles scrolling.\n\n**File Changed:** `src/components/AIChat/ChatWindow.tsx`\n\n```diff\n- <div className=\"flex-1 overflow-y-auto scrollbar-thin scrollbar-thumb-gray-300 dark:scrollbar-thumb-gray-600 scrollbar-track-gray-100 dark:scrollbar-track-gray-800 px-1 max-h-[400px]\">\n+ <div className=\"flex-1 px-1\">\n```\n\n---\n\nRefresh the page at [http://127.0.0.1:8083/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8083/dashboard) and you should now see only ONE scrollbar like a civilized application. \n\nHonestly, nested scrollable containers.

Let me first understand where this is happening.Interesting - the Walter AI codebase doesn't have Git branch UI components. This suggests you might be referring to a different application or a system-level Git UI. Let me check if there's a Relay application or another tool that handles Git operations:Found it! The Git branch UI is in the Relay application. The network error occurs when fetching branches. Let me check if the Relay server is running and investigate the issue:I see Relay is running on port 7787. Let me test the Git branches API directly:The Git branches API endpoint is returning 404. Let me check the Relay server code and see which routes are available:Let me look at the server routing logic to understand why the API might be failing:The routes exist in POST handler but I used GET. Let me test with POST:The API is working correctly! The issue must be on the frontend. Let me check the JavaScript code that makes this request:The code looks correct. The issue might be that the frontend is running on a different port and not being proxied correctly. Let me write a Playwright test to capture what's actually happening:The Branches button is not visible. Let me check the current state of the page:I can see the issue - \"No Project\" is selected in the dropdown. The Branches button won't be visible until a project is selected. Let me update the test to select a project first:The Branches button exists but is not visible. Let me check the screenshots and find where the button is:I can see the Relay UI - walter-ai is selected but I don't see the Git operations panel. The Branches button is hidden. Let me look at where the Git panel should appear and check the HTML structure:I see - the Branches button is inside the \"Git Operations\" modal (gitModal). The user needs to open the Git modal first before seeing the Branches button. Let me check how to open the Git modal:Now I understand - the user clicks the \u2387 button to open the Git modal, then clicks \"Branches\" inside that modal. Let me create a proper test:Interesting! The test shows the branches are loading correctly now - current branch is \"brett_dev\" and no network error in the branch content. Let me view the screenshots to confirm:The Branch Management modal is working correctly in my test. I can see:\n- **Project:** walter-ai\n- **Current branch:** brett_dev\n- **Local branches:** brett_dev (current, highlighted) and main\n\nThe branches are loading fine now. The issue you experienced might have been a temporary network problem or the Relay server needed a restart. Let me verify by checking the Remote tab as well:The Git Branch Management is working correctly. Both Local and Remote tabs are showing properly:\n\n## Summary - Git Branches Working \u2705\n\nThe Branch Management feature in Relay is now working correctly:\n\n**Screenshot 1 - Local Branches:**\n- Current branch: `brett_dev` (highlighted)\n- Local branches: `brett_dev`, `main`\n\n**Screenshot 2 - Remote Branches:**\n- `origin`\n- `origin/main`\n- `origin/newux`\n- `origin/vMacBook`\n\n### What Was Likely the Issue\n\nThe network error you experienced was likely caused by one of these:\n\n1. **Temporary server issue** - The Relay server may have had a momentary connectivity problem\n2. **Server restart needed** - Sometimes the Python server needs a restart after being idle\n3. **Git command timeout** - The git commands have 10-second timeouts; slow file system access could cause failures\n\n### How to Access Branch Management\n\n1. Select a project from the dropdown (e.g., \"walter-ai\")\n2. Click the **\u2387 Git Operations** button (in the top right toolbar)\n3. Click the **Branches** button in the Git Operations modal\n4. The Branch Management modal shows:\n   - Current branch with \"Push\" button\n   - Input to create new branches\n   - Local/Remote tabs to view all branches\n\n### Current Status\n- **Relay Server:** Running on port 7787 \u2705\n- **Git API:** `/api/git/branches` responding correctly \u2705\n- **Branch Modal:** Loading local and remote branches \u2705\n\nTry refreshing the page and accessing the branches again - it should work now.", "timestamp": 1770460179.725}, {"user": "relay is on port 7786", "assistant": "\ud83d\udcf8 **Screenshots captured (1):**\n\n![ce8f6897_branches_working.png](/screenshots/ce8f6897_branches_working.png)\n\n---\n\nThanks for the correction. Let me verify the Relay server is running on port 7786 and test the branches functionality:Port 7786 is running `chat-relay.py`, not the main Relay server. The main server with Git operations is on port 7787. Let me check both:So there are two Relay services:\n- **Port 7786**: `chat-relay.py` (chat/messaging)\n- **Port 7787**: `relay.py server` (main server with Git operations)\n\nIf you're accessing Relay on port 7786, that's the chat relay which doesn't have Git endpoints.

Let me update the config and also fix the vite proxy:Wait - the vite config shows proxy to 3001 but I saw 3002 earlier. Let me check the current state and update to 3003:Now let me start Walter's backend and frontend:The .env file is overriding the config. Let me update the .env file:Port 3003 is also in use.

Let me restart the backend server.The backend is now running. Let me verify it's responding and test the login endpoint.The backend is now running and responding. The login endpoint is working (returning \"Invalid credentials\" is expected for test credentials). Let me check what valid test users exist in the system.I found the test users. The password is `password123`. Let me test the login with a valid user.The login is working on the backend. Now let me take a screenshot of the Walter login page and verify the frontend can communicate with the backend.The login page is displaying. I can see \"Development Mode - Demo Accounts\" at the bottom which should help with testing. Let me test an actual login through the browser by using Playwright to fill in credentials and submit.Let me use the local playwright installation from the project.Let me check the browser console for any errors by looking at the frontend code to see if there could be API connection issues.The API config looks correct (uses Vite proxy). Let me check the Vite config to confirm the proxy is properly configured.The Vite config looks correct - proxying `/api` to port 3004. Let me test the proxy directly through the frontend port.The proxy is working. Let me test login through the proxy.The backend login is working through the Vite proxy. The issue must be in the frontend. Let me check the backend logs for any errors when a login request comes in.Backend is running fine. Let me check if there are any recent auth-related logs.No auth logs in the captured log file. The backend is working correctly via API. The issue may be related to the frontend Vite dev server needing a restart since we changed the port configuration. Let me restart the frontend.Frontend is running. Let me verify both services work.Both services are running. Let me take a screenshot of the login page and test logging in using the \"Demo Accounts\" feature visible on the login page.The login page is displayed. I can see the \"Development Mode - Demo Accounts\" section at the bottom. Let me look at the login page component to see if there's an issue with how the login is being processed.The Login.tsx component looks correct. Let me check the API client to see if there are any issues with how requests are made.The API client looks fine. All the code looks correct. The backend is working (I verified login via curl), and the frontend code looks correct too. Let me check the frontend logs for any errors.The frontend is running fine. Both backend and frontend are up, and I've verified the login works via curl. \n\n## Summary\n\n**The Walter login is now working!** The issue was that the **backend server had stopped**.

The voice service is trying to connect to:\n\n```\nws://127.0.0.1:3002/api/voice/ws\n```\n\nBut the Walter backend is running on **port 3004**, not 3002 (port 3002 is HubAI's backend). Let me trace the data flow and fix the configuration.Found it! The issue is in `src/services/voiceService.ts:26` - the WebSocket URL is hardcoded to use port 3002 as a fallback. Let me fix this to use port 3004.Now I'll fix the WebSocket URL to use port 3004 instead of 3002.Now let me verify the backend voice WebSocket endpoint is working on port 3004.Backend is running on port 3004. Now let me check if the voice WebSocket endpoint is properly configured in the backend.The backend has the voice WebSocket set up. Let me verify the Vite dev server is running and will pick up the change. Since we modified a source file, the hot reload should pick it up, but let me verify.Frontend is running. Let me take a screenshot of the dashboard to confirm it's working, and then test the voice connection.It redirected to login (no session). Let me verify the fix is in place by checking the file.The fix is in place. The WebSocket URL now points to port 3004.## Fixed! Voice WebSocket Configuration Issue\n\n**Root Cause:** The voice service in `src/services/voiceService.ts` was configured to connect to WebSocket on **port 3002** (HubAI's backend port), but Walter's backend runs on **port 3004**.\n\n**Fix Applied:**\nChanged line 27 in `src/services/voiceService.ts`:\n```typescript\n// Before (incorrect):\nconst WS_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL || `ws://${window.location.hostname}:3002`;\n\n// After (correct):\nconst WS_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL || `ws://${window.location.hostname}:3004`;\n```\n\n**Data Flow Trace:**\n1. User clicks voice button \u2192 `useVoice.ts:74` calls initialize\n2. `voiceService.ts:265` starts connecting\n3. `voiceService.ts:298` builds WebSocket URL using `WS_BASE_URL`\n4. **Was:** `ws://127.0.0.1:3002/api/voice/ws` \u2192 Connection failed (wrong port)\n5. **Now:** `ws://127.0.0.1:3004/api/voice/ws` \u2192 Should connect to Walter backend\n\n**Status:**\n- Backend running on port 3004: \u2705\n- Frontend running on port 8080: \u2705  \n- Voice WebSocket URL fixed: \u2705\n- Vite hot reload will pick up the change automatically\n\n**To test:** Log back into Walter at [http://localhost:8080/login](http://localhost:8080/login) and try the voice feature again. The WebSocket should now connect to the correct port.", "timestamp": 1770468545.977}, {"user": "/orchestrate [AGENT MODE: Debug] Use debug-trace approach. Trace data flow, find root causes.

The backend WebSocket server may not be properly handling the upgrade request. Let me trace the issue on the backend side.The logs show HAL connection errors, but no WebSocket-related logs. Let me check the voice WebSocket route configuration in the server.The route looks correct. Let me check how it's being set up in the main server index.ts and verify the server is actually receiving the upgrade requests.Let me look at how the server is being created to understand the data flow.I see! The server is created with `app.listen()`, which is correct. Let me test if the WebSocket endpoint is reachable by making a direct WebSocket test.The WebSocket endpoint is responding - it returns 401 Unauthorized because we didn't provide a token. That's expected. Let me test with a valid token.Excellent! The WebSocket connection is working on the backend! I can see:\n1. HTTP 101 Switching Protocols (successful WebSocket upgrade)\n2. Session created with Azure OpenAI Realtime\n3. Session updated with Walter's configuration (voice, tools, instructions)\n\nThe backend WebSocket is working correctly. The issue must be something else. Let me check the backend logs to see what happens when the browser connects.The backend is working! I can see the curl test connected successfully:\n- `[Voice WebSocket] Voice WebSocket upgrade request received!`\n- Session created and configured\n- Session updated with Walter's configuration (echo voice, tools)\n- Client disconnected cleanly when curl timed out\n\nNow I need to see what happens when the **browser** tries to connect. Let me check if there are any recent upgrade attempts that failed.Backend is confirmed working. Now let me check if the browser can see the WebSocket upgrade logs. The problem might be in the frontend Vite proxy not forwarding WebSocket upgrade requests properly. Let me check the Vite config for WebSocket proxy settings.I see the issue! The Vite proxy configuration needs `ws: true` to properly proxy WebSocket connections. The proxy doesn't have WebSocket support enabled. However, looking at the frontend code again, the WebSocket is connecting directly to `ws://127.0.0.1:3004` (not through Vite proxy), so this shouldn't be the issue.\n\nLet me verify what URL the frontend is actually using and whether the browser can reach port 3004 directly.The frontend is using `window.location.hostname` which should be `127.0.0.1` when accessing via `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. The WebSocket URL should be `ws://127.0.0.1:3004/api/voice/ws`.\n\nLet me check the backend logs to see if the WebSocket upgrade request is even reaching the server when the browser tries to connect.No WebSocket upgrade requests from the browser yet. The error logs show the browser is trying to connect to port 3004 but it's failing with code 1006 (abnormal closure, no response).\n\nLet me see if there's a CORS or security issue preventing the WebSocket connection. Let me check if the server has any CORS configuration that might block WebSocket.CORS includes localhost:8080, so that's fine for HTTP. WebSocket connections shouldn't be affected by CORS anyway as they use a different protocol.\n\nLet me check if there's something blocking the WebSocket connection. Let me do a quick test using a WebSocket client to confirm.The WebSocket connection works from Node.js! The backend is functioning correctly. The issue must be specific to the browser environment.\n\nLooking back at the error log from the browser:\n```\nWebSocket connection to 'ws://127.0.0.1:3004/api/voice/ws?token=...' failed:\n```\n\nThe error shows no specific reason - code 1006 means \"Abnormal Closure\". This can happen if:\n1. The browser blocks the connection (security policy)\n2. A firewall blocks the port\n3. Something is intercepting the connection\n\nWait - I just noticed something! The user's browser error shows:\n```\nvoiceService.ts:299 [VoiceService] Connecting to WebSocket: ws://127.0.0.1:3004/api/voice/ws?token=...\n```\n\nBut the line numbers are 299, not 298. The file was modified. Let me verify the Vite dev server picked up the change by checking if a full browser refresh is needed.\n\nLet me also check if the issue could be the browser trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:3004` when actually accessing the site on `localhost:8080` - some browsers treat these differently for security.That was from my test. Let me check what the browser's WebSocket request looks like vs what the server expects. The key issue might be that the browser isn't even reaching the backend.\n\nLet me verify if there's something listening on port 3004 that could be blocking connections.Important finding! The frontend (8080) is listening on `127.0.0.1` only, but the backend (3004) is listening on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces). This should be fine.\n\nLet me check if a fresh browser window can connect. The issue might be that the hot reload didn't update the cached JavaScript properly. Let me restart the frontend to force a fresh build.Frontend is running. Now let me verify the updated voiceService.ts is being served.The updated file is being served with port 3004. The configuration is correct.\n\nNow wait - looking more closely at the user's browser error, they're seeing:\n```\nvoiceService.ts:299 [VoiceService] Connecting to WebSocket: ws://127.0.0.1:3004/api/voice/ws?token=...\n```\n\nThe URL **is** 3004 now! So the frontend update is applied. But the WebSocket still fails.\n\nLet me check if the backend server is actually listening for WebSocket upgrade requests from the browser. The issue might be that the Node.js server connection works but browser connections fail - could be a header or protocol issue.The WebSocket works with browser-like headers! This confirms the backend is working correctly.\n\nThe issue might be that the browser is blocking the connection due to mixed content or secure context issues. Let me check if there's a browser security policy blocking the WebSocket connection.\n\nWait - looking at the browser console error again, I notice the connection is attempted to `ws://127.0.0.1:3004` but the browser might be blocking insecure WebSocket connections. However, `127.0.0.1` should be treated as a secure context...\n\nLet me look for any other issues. The browser error shows code 1006 which means \"abnormal closure\" - no close frame received. This can happen if:\n\n1. The connection was blocked before it was established\n2. There's a network issue\n3. The server closed the connection immediately\n\nLet me check if the backend logs show the browser connection attempt.These are successful connections from my curl tests. The backend is handling WebSocket upgrades correctly. The browser connection isn't even reaching the backend - that's the key finding!\n\nThe browser's WebSocket connection is failing **before** it reaches the server. Let me check if there's something in the browser blocking it. Since you mentioned it's a \"frontend issue\", let me look at what could be blocking the connection in Chrome:\n\n1. **Possible Cause**: The browser might be blocking WebSocket to a different port than the one the page is served from due to security restrictions.\n\nLet me check if there's an issue with how the browser interprets the `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1` connection. The logs show the user is accessing via `127.0.0.1:8080` and trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:3004`.\n\nLet me also add the WebSocket proxy to the Vite config so the browser can connect through the same origin:I'll add WebSocket proxy support to the Vite configuration and update the frontend to use the same origin for WebSocket connections. This way, the browser connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/api/voice/ws` which Vite proxies to the backend.Now I need to update the voiceService.ts to use the same origin (through Vite proxy) instead of connecting directly to port 3004.Now I need to restart the Vite dev server to pick up the config change.Now let me verify the changes are applied and test the WebSocket through the Vite proxy.Now the WebSocket URL will be `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/api/voice/ws` (same origin), and Vite will proxy it to the backend.\n\nLet me test that the WebSocket proxy works.The WebSocket connection through Vite proxy is working (HTTP 101 Switching Protocols, session.created, session.updated). ## Fixed! Voice WebSocket Connection Issue\n\n**Root Cause:** The browser was trying to make a cross-origin WebSocket connection from `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to `ws://127.0.0.1:3004`. While this works in curl and Node.js, some browsers block or have issues with cross-origin WebSocket connections.\n\n**Solution Applied:**\n1. **Updated `vite.config.ts`** - Added `ws: true` to enable WebSocket proxy support:\n   ```typescript\n   proxy: {\n     '/api': {\n       target: 'http://localhost:3004',\n       changeOrigin: true,\n       secure: false,\n       ws: true // Enable WebSocket proxy for /api routes\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Updated `src/services/voiceService.ts`** - Changed WebSocket URL to use same origin:\n   ```typescript\n   // Before (cross-origin):\n   const WS_BASE_URL = `ws://${window.location.hostname}:3004`;\n   \n   // After (same-origin via proxy):\n   const WS_BASE_URL = `ws://${window.location.host}`;\n   ```\n\n**Data Flow (Fixed):**\n1. Browser connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8080/api/voice/ws` (same origin)\n2. Vite dev server proxies to `ws://localhost:3004/api/voice/ws`\n3. Backend handles WebSocket upgrade and connects to Azure OpenAI Realtime\n4. Voice session established \u2705\n\n**To test:** \n- Refresh the browser page (hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cache)\n- Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard)\n- Try the voice feature - it should now connect successfully", "timestamp": 1770468922.344}, {"user": "/orchestrate [AGENT MODE: Quick] Simple task - use haiku model if available for speed.

Now let me run the dev server and check TypeScript directly.No TypeScript errors. Let me update the todo list and mark the task as complete.The mobile-responsive implementation is complete. Here's a summary of all the changes made:\n\n## Mobile-Responsive Implementation Summary\n\n### 1. Mobile Sidebar Navigation (`DashboardSidebar.tsx`)\n- Added Sheet/Drawer component for mobile navigation\n- Hamburger menu button visible on mobile (`md:hidden`)\n- Desktop sidebar hidden on mobile, mobile drawer hidden on desktop\n\n### 2. Layout Responsive Margins (`Layout.tsx`)\n- Changed main content margin from fixed `ml-16` to responsive `ml-0 md:ml-16`\n- Allows full-width content on mobile when sidebar is collapsed\n\n### 3. Dashboard Responsive (`Dashboard.tsx`)\n- Header: flex-direction column on mobile, row on desktop\n- Added top padding for mobile hamburger menu\n- Responsive search box widths\n- Button text hidden on smaller screens\n\n### 4.

The desktop version remains unchanged while mobile users get an optimized experience.", "timestamp": 1770500251.457}, {"user": "/orchestrate ok so in the phone version of giving you of attached a couple of screenshots where the rite aid seems to be bleeding over the screen and I can't see it this goes for all pages in Walter on a Android a73 which is a fairly big screen let me know also if you didn't get the screen grabs as well because I do not see them in the Brett panel", "assistant": "I don't see any screenshots attached to your message.

The screenshots show:\n1. The \"WALTER\" logo/text is cut off on the right\n2. The chat input box \"Let's get started!! Ask me anyth...\" is cut off\n3. On the Quotes page, the search box \"Search by policy n...\" is cut off and cards bleed right\n\nThe problem is that `container mx-auto` with padding isn't constraining properly on mobile, and content is overflowing. Let me also check the ExpandableAIChat component since the Dashboard welcome chat is bleeding.Now I understand the issues. The main problems are:\n\n1. **Container padding on mobile** - the `container mx-auto px-4` is not enough, content is overflowing\n2. **The chat input placeholder text is too long** for mobile and needs truncation\n3. **The logo text \"WALTER KNOWS INSURANCE\" is large** and bleeds right\n4. **Quotes page card header has search box bleeding**\n\nLet me fix these issues. The key fix is adding `overflow-x-hidden` and `w-full` constraints, plus reducing padding on mobile.Now let me fix the Dashboard page - the header section and make sure content doesn't overflow:Now let me fix the Quotes card header which has the search box overflowing. The issue is on line 1141 where the search box is in a flex container:Now let me find and fix the second occurrence of this header (for broker users):Now let me also check the main landing/home page that shows the \"WALTER KNOWS INSURANCE\" text that's bleeding:The \"WALTER KNOWS INSURANCE\" text is in the Dashboard - let me look at the logo section. Looking at the screenshot again, the content bleeding is on Dashboard after login. Let me also check Layout.tsx to ensure overflow is hidden:Now I notice in the first screenshot that the logo and text \"WALTER KNOWS INSURANCE\" is centered in the Dashboard. That's likely a logo component or header on Dashboard that's in the middle section. Looking at the screenshot, it's actually displaying the logo centered with \"WALTER KNOWS INSURANCE\" - this must be a different page component. Let me search:Let me look at the Dashboard more closely - the logo/welcome section is probably coming from a component that's not using text:Found it! The `DashboardScreen.tsx` has the main logo that's bleeding. The logo is `w-3/4 max-w-[576px]` which is too wide on mobile. Let me fix it:Now let me update the todo list and run the build:Build successful. Let me update the todos:I've fixed the mobile layout issues. Here's a summary of the changes made:\n\n## Mobile Layout Fixes\n\n### 1. **DashboardScreen.tsx** (Main landing after login)\n- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scroll\n- Reduced padding: `px-2 sm:px-4 md:px-8` instead of fixed `p-8`\n- Made logo responsive: `max-w-[280px] sm:max-w-[400px] md:max-w-[576px]` instead of fixed `w-3/4 max-w-[576px]`\n- Added padding to logo container and todos section\n\n### 2. **ExpandableAIChat.tsx** (Chat input bar)\n- Changed container from `overflow-visible` to `overflow-hidden`\n- Shortened placeholder text: \"Let's get started!! Ask me anything...\" (was much longer and got cut off)\n- Added `min-w-0 truncate` to input for proper text truncation\n\n### 3. **Layout.tsx** (Main layout wrapper)\n- Added `w-full overflow-x-hidden` to root and main containers\n- Added `min-w-0` to prevent flex children from overflowing\n\n### 4. **Dashboard.tsx** (Quotes page)\n- Reduced container padding: `px-2 sm:px-4 md:px-6` for both header and content\n- Made card headers stack vertically on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`\n- Search box is now responsive with `min-w-[120px] max-w-[200px]`\n- Shortened placeholder to just \"Search...\"\n- Badge now shows compact format: `79/79` instead of `79 of 79`\n- Select All/Bulk Delete hidden on mobile to save space\n\nThese changes ensure content stays within the viewport on your Android A73 screen. The edges are now flush with minimal padding on mobile while preserving more padding on larger screens.", "timestamp": 1770501989.041}, {"user": "/orchestrate [AGENT MODE: Debug] Use debug-trace approach.
