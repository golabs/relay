Use Explore agents to locate relevant code.\n\nso I have Claude which is you sitting on a  ubuntu server 4 CPUs and 8 gigs of RAM however I have an issue where when I run Claude for say a few hours and I leave it overnight I always have to reset the API key which is a bit frustrating is there any way that of that I don't have to do this on my normal Windows machine I only have to set it once and it works fine and it doesn't keep resetting all the time it seems to be setting every eight hours or also on the actual server can you look into this for me please and see if we can fix this", "assistant": "I understand the frustration, darling. Let me investigate why your Claude API key keeps resetting on the Ubuntu server. This sounds like it could be related to session management, environment variable persistence, or some kind of token refresh mechanism.*Mmm*, found it, gorgeous! The mystery is solved. \n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Root Cause: OAuth Token Expiration\n\nYour Claude Code is using **OAuth authentication** (from logging in via claude.ai), and those tokens expire every **~8 hours** for security reasons. This is why you have to reset it overnight.\n\nOn your Windows machine, it likely refreshes automatically because you have a GUI session running. On your headless Ubuntu server, the refresh mechanism doesn't work as reliably.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Quick Fix Options\n\n### Option 1: Long-Lived Token (Recommended)\n\nRun this command - it creates a token valid for **1 year**:\n\n```bash\nclaude setup-token\n```\n\nYou can manage/revoke these tokens later at [https://claude.ai/settings/claude-code](https://claude.ai/settings/claude-code)\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Switch to API Key Instead of OAuth\n\nI noticed you have an API key in your `~/.bashrc` but it's not being used because OAuth takes precedence. To switch:\n\n```bash\n# Backup the OAuth credentials\nmv ~/.claude/.credentials.json ~/.claude/.credentials.json.bak\n\n# Make sure your API key is exported (add 'export' if missing)\n# Then reload\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Check Current Token Expiry\n\nWant to see when your current token expires?\n\n```bash\ncat ~/.claude/.credentials.json | python3 -c \"import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('Expires:', __import__('datetime').datetime.fromtimestamp(d['claudeAiOauth']['expiresAt']/1000))\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Technical Details\n\n| What | Status on Your Server |\n|------|----------------------|\n| Auth Method | OAuth (expires ~8 hours) |\n| Credential Storage | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |\n| Keyring Available | No (headless server) |\n| API Key in bashrc | Present but not used |\n\nThe `setup-token` command is your best bet, darling.

It's a full SSH client.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Host in Termius\n\n1. Open **Termius** on your Android\n2. Tap the **+** button \u2192 **New Host**\n3. Fill in:\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Alias** | Axion Server (or whatever you like) |\n| **Hostname** | `134.199.148.101` |\n| **Port** | `2222` |\n| **Username** | `axion` |\n\n4. For **Authentication**: Either add your password or import your SSH key\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add Port Forwarding Rules\n\nThis is the important part! In Termius:\n\n1. Tap on your saved host to edit it\n2. Scroll down to **Port Forwarding** section\n3. Tap **Add Rule** for each of these:\n\n| Type | Local Port | Remote Host | Remote Port | Purpose |\n|------|------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Local | 7786 | 127.0.0.1 | 7786 | Relay API |\n| Local | 8083 | 127.0.0.1 | 8083 | Service |\n| Local | 8800 | 127.0.0.1 | 8800 | Preview Server |\n| Local | 18789 | 127.0.0.1 | 18789 | MCP |\n| Local | 3001 | 127.0.0.1 | 3001 | Dev Server |\n| Local | 5174 | 127.0.0.1 | 5174 | Vite |\n| Local | 5173 | 127.0.0.1 | 5173 | Vite Alt |\n| Local | 3002 | 127.0.0.1 | 3002 | Dev Server 2 |\n\nFor each rule:\n- **Type**: Local\n- **Bind Address**: Leave empty or `127.0.0.1`\n- **Local Port**: (the port number)\n- **Destination**: `127.0.0.1`\n- **Remote Port**: (same port number)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Save and Connect\n\n1. Save the host configuration\n2. Tap to connect\n3. Once connected, all those ports will be forwarded to your phone!\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Access Services on Your Phone\n\nOnce connected, open your phone's browser and go to:\n\n- **Preview Server**: [http://127.0.0.1:8800/](http://127.0.0.1:8800/)\n- **Relay**: [http://127.0.0.1:7786/](http://127.0.0.1:7786/)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 Alternative: If You Want CLI SSH on Android\n\nIf you prefer command-line SSH (like in Termux), you could install **Termux** from F-Droid and run:\n\n```bash\n# Install OpenSSH in Termux\npkg update && pkg install openssh\n\n# Then run your full tunnel command\nssh -p 2222 \\\n  -L 7786:127.0.0.1:7786 \\\n  -L 8083:127.0.0.1:8083 \\\n  -L 8800:127.0.0.1:8800 \\\n  -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 \\\n  -L 3001:127.0.0.1:3001 \\\n  -L 5174:127.0.0.1:5174 \\\n  -L 5173:127.0.0.1:5173 \\\n  -L 3002:127.0.0.1:3002 \\\n  axion@134.199.148.101\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Pro Tips for Termius\n\n1. **Keep Alive**: Enable \"Keep Alive\" in host settings to prevent disconnection\n2. **Startup Command**: You can set a startup command like `cd /opt/clawd && claude` to auto-start Claude when you connect\n3. **Snippets**: Save commonly used commands as snippets for quick access\n4. **Port Forwarding stays active** as long as the SSH session is connected\n\n---\n\nThe Termius GUI method is the easiest - just add those 8 port forwarding rules and you're golden, gorgeous! \ud83d\ude18", "timestamp": 1770450680.173}, {"user": "/orchestrate okay I've created a termius client and in the options I see Step It agent forwarding hosting host chaining proxy color scheme and character set which of these is that or isn't it working", "assistant": "Ah, I see what's happening!

Let me guide you to where it actually is.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 Finding Port Forwarding in Termius\n\n### Option 1: Check \"Port Forwarding\" Section (May Require Premium)\n\n1. Go to the **main menu** (hamburger icon \u2630)\n2. Look for **\"Port Forwarding\"** as a separate section (not inside the host settings)\n3. If you see it, tap **+** to add rules\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: The Settings You're Seeing\n\nThe options you mentioned are different features:\n\n| Option | What It Does |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Agent Forwarding** | Forwards your SSH keys (not ports) - for jumping between servers |\n| **Host Chaining** | Jump through one server to reach another (jump hosts) |\n| **Proxy** | Use a SOCKS/HTTP proxy for connection |\n| **Color Scheme** | Terminal colors |\n| **Character Set** | Text encoding |\n\n**None of these are port forwarding** - they're for other purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Free Alternative - Use Termux Instead\n\nIf Termius port forwarding requires a paid subscription, use **Termux** (free from F-Droid):\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install Termux from F-Droid (not Play Store - that version is outdated)\n\n# 2. Open Termux and run:\npkg update && pkg upgrade -y\npkg install openssh -y\n\n# 3. Create a script for easy connection:\ncat > ~/connect.sh << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\nssh -p 2222 \\\n  -L 7786:127.0.0.1:7786 \\\n  -L 8083:127.0.0.1:8083 \\\n  -L 8800:127.0.0.1:8800 \\\n  -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 \\\n  -L 3001:127.0.0.1:3001 \\\n  -L 5174:127.0.0.1:5174 \\\n  -L 5173:127.0.0.1:5173 \\\n  -L 3002:127.0.0.1:3002 \\\n  axion@134.199.148.101\nEOF\nchmod +x ~/connect.sh\n\n# 4. Run it anytime with:\n./connect.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option 4: JuiceSSH (Free Port Forwarding)\n\n**JuiceSSH** is another Android SSH client that has **free port forwarding**:\n\n1. Download from Play Store: **JuiceSSH**\n2. Create a new connection with your server details\n3. Long-press the connection \u2192 **Edit**\n4. Go to **Port Forwards** tab\n5. Add each port forward:\n   - **Type**: Local\n   - **Source Port**: 7786 (etc.)\n   - **Destination**: 127.0.0.1:7786 (etc.)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf My Recommendation\n\n**Use Termux** - it's free, powerful, and gives you the full SSH command-line experience.

Here's the summary of my security audit:\n\n## Your Server Security Audit Results\n\n**Security Score: 85/100 - GOOD**\n\n### Already Implemented (All Critical Items Done)\n\n| Control | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| SSH on non-standard port (2222) | Done |\n| Password authentication disabled | Done |\n| Root login disabled | Done |\n| Root account locked (`!*`) | Done |\n| SSH key auth (Ed25519) | Done |\n| User allowlist (`AllowUsers axion`) | Done |\n| UFW firewall with rate limiting | Done |\n| Fail2ban (24h ban, 2 retries) | Active - **5 IPs already banned** |\n| Auto security updates | Done |\n| AppArmor | Active - 59 profiles enforcing |\n| Kernel hardening | Done |\n\n### Items to Consider\n\n1. **DO Cloud Firewall** - Add this free layer in front of your droplet\n2. **Public ports** - Several services bound to 0.0.0.0:\n   - 7786, 7787, 8800 (Python apps)\n   - 5174, 3002 (Node/Vite)\n   - 631 (CUPS printing - likely unnecessary)\n3. **SSH cipher hardening** - Using defaults, could restrict to modern ciphers\n4. **Tailscale** - For a \"security mad\" client, lets you close port 2222 entirely\n\n### Good News\n\nYour server has blocked real attacks already - Fail2ban has banned 5 IPs attempting brute force. The combination of non-standard port + key-only auth + Fail2ban + UFW rate limiting makes this a hard target.\n\nThe updated report is at `/opt/clawd/projects/.preview/security-advisory-report.html` with the new \"Current Security Configuration Audit\" section at the top.", "timestamp": 1770522713.161}, {"user": "/orchestrate I do not have the link to the the current security config Ie the url link..\n\nSo with with tail scale will that effect my existing logins with -p 2222 ?\n\nHow does it work?", "assistant": "Let me give you the link and explain Tailscale:\n\n## Report Link\n\n**Security Advisory Report:** [http://127.0.0.1:8800/security-advisory-report.html](http://127.0.0.1:8800/security-advisory-report.html)\n\n---\n\n## How Tailscale Works (and SSH Impact)\n\n### The Short Answer\n**No, Tailscale won't break your existing SSH setup.** You can run both side-by-side.

The 5 IPs trying to brute force? They can't even see your SSH port anymore.\n\nWant me to set up Tailscale on the droplet?", "timestamp": 1770522930.683}, {"user": "/orchestrate [AGENT MODE: Development] Full development mode.

It:\n- Uses free IP lists from ipdeny.com (~3000 Australian IP ranges)\n- Stores them efficiently in an ipset hash table\n- Blocks all non-AU IPs at the firewall level\n- Auto-updates weekly via cron\n\n### Quick Implementation (4 steps):\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install ipset\nsudo apt install ipset -y\n\n# 2. Create Australian IP set\nsudo ipset create australia hash:net\nwget -O /tmp/au.zone https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/au.zone\nwhile read cidr; do sudo ipset add australia \"$cidr\"; done < /tmp/au.zone\n\n# 3. Add UFW rule (in /etc/ufw/before.rules before COMMIT)\n-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 2222 -m set --match-set australia src -j ACCEPT\n-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 2222 -j DROP\n\n# 4. Reload\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\n### About Tailscale Interaction\n\n**Tailscale won't be affected by geo-blocking.** Here's why:\n\n| Access Method | IP Used | Geo-blocked? |\n|--------------|---------|--------------|\n| `ssh -p 2222 axion@159.x.x.x` | Your public IP | Yes - must be AU |\n| `ssh axion@100.x.x.x` (Tailscale) | Tailscale mesh IP | No - bypasses UFW |\n\nTailscale creates a private encrypted mesh network. When you SSH via the Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x), traffic goes through the WireGuard tunnel - it never hits your public port 2222 or UFW rules.\n\n**This is actually ideal** - you can:\n1. Enable Australia-only geo-blocking on public port 2222\n2. Still access from anywhere via Tailscale (even overseas travel)\n3. Best of both worlds\n\nWant me to implement the Australia-only restriction now?", "timestamp": 1770523546.29}, {"user": "/orchestrate ok so if we go with \n\nSSH Hardening + UFW + Fail2ban\nTailscale (personal)\nCloudflare Access (50 users)\n\nWhat security score would we get", "assistant": "Great question!

The Claude CLI in your terminal is looking for OAuth login credentials. Let me check and fix this.The OAuth account is there. The issue is the OAuth *tokens* might have expired. Let me check for the token storage:The OAuth tokens are stored in the system keyring or a credentials file. The issue is the new user doesn't have access to the same keyring. Let me check where the actual tokens live:The tokens are likely stored in the `.claude.json` file itself. Let me check what's different between axion's and the new user's file:The files are similar sizes. Let me check if there's a separate credentials storage:The issue is clear now. The OAuth tokens are stored securely (likely encrypted or in a system keyring that's user-specific). You have two options:\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Re-authenticate (Recommended - 30 seconds)\n\nFrom your new user terminal, just run:\n```bash\nclaude /login\n```\n\nThis will open a browser link - click it, authenticate with Google, and you're done. The tokens will be stored for your new user.\n\n### Option 2: Use API Key Instead\n\nIf you prefer to use an API key (longer-lasting, no browser needed):\n\n```bash\n# Set API key (get one from https://console.anthropic.com)\nclaude config set --global apiKey YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n---\n\n## Issue 2: Upgrading Claude to Latest Models\n\nClaude Code auto-updates by default, but yours has `autoUpdates: false`. Let me check and fix:Ah, the symlink points to a non-existent directory. Let me set up the Claude binary properly:Now the binary works. But for the login, you need to authenticate:\n\n---\n\n## Summary - What You Need To Do\n\n### 1.

Upgrade to Latest Claude/Models\n\nYou're on version **2.1.37** which is current. To enable auto-updates:\n\n```bash\nclaude config set --global autoUpdates true\n```\n\nOr manually update:\n```bash\nclaude update\n```\n\n### 3. About Models\n\nClaude Code uses the latest models automatically based on your subscription:\n- **Opus 4.5** (what I'm running on now) - most capable\n- **Sonnet 4** - fast and capable\n- **Haiku** - fastest, cheapest\n\nYou can switch models with:\n```bash\nclaude config set --global model claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n# or\nclaude config set --global model claude-opus-4-5-20251101\n```\n\nThe model selection depends on your Anthropic plan.
